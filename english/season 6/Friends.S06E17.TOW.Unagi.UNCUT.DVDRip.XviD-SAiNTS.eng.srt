00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:08,801
Remember when I had a monkey?
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,238
What was I thinking?
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:17,575
Hey, so, what's with the 20 percent
tip? Did I do something wrong?
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:21,019
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:23,381
You know what's more generous?
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:28,752
-You know what's even more generous?
-I see where you're going.
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:30,929
What's up with the greed?
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:32,561
I'm sorry.
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:37,326
I have to get new headshots made,
and they're really expensive.
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,198
I'm down to, like, three.
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:43,504
Actually, two, because one of them
I blackened some teeth.
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:45,438
Why'd I do that?
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:49,338
Isn't there something you can do
to earn extra money?
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:52,449
Can't you pick up an extra shift here?
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:55,846
Or, you know, I used to beg for money.
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,921
It helps if you've got
a little of this going on.
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,392
Wow! I still have it.
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:07,798
Don't you have an audition today?
Maybe you'll get that job.
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:12,364
Wait a minute.
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,473
I used to get medical experiments
done on me.
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:18,600
Finally, an explanation.
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:22,809
I used to get paid for
all kinds of medical stuff.
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:27,281
Let's see... Well, I don't want
to donate sperm again.
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:30,114
I really prefer doing that
at the home office.
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:34,616
Maybe they want some of my blood
or spit or something, huh?
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,187
-Joey?
-Yeah.
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:39,832
What did I tell you
about talking while working?
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:41,124
Do it?
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:47,399
That guy's been waiting 10 minutes.
He's complained about you three times.
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:51,137
Now, where was I?
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,739
The One With Unagi
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,746
What are you up to?
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:36,080
We went to a self-defense class today.
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,985
Kicking a guy in the crotch all
morning really takes it out of you.
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,290
Takes it out of you?
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,295
Now we can kick anybody's ass.
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,763
After one class?
I don't think so.
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,599
You want to see me self-defend myself?
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,806
Pretend you're a predator.
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,200
Go on, I dare you!
00:02:56,776 --> 00:03:00,644
Of course you can defend yourself from
an attack you know is coming.
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,678
That's not enough.
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:06,113
Look, I studied karate
for a long time.
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,487
And there's a concept you
should be familiar with.
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:14,955
It's what the Japanese call unagi.
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,694
Isn't that a kind of sushi?
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:20,891
No, it's a concept.
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:24,000
Yeah, it is.
It's freshwater eel.
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,070
Maybe it means that too.
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:29,400
I would kill for
a salmon-skin roll right now.
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:32,770
Fine, get attacked.
I don't even care.
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:37,813
Come on, Ross, we're sorry.
Please tell us what it is.
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:44,819
Unagi is a state of total awareness.
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,818
Only by achieving true unagi...
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:52,326
can you be prepared for any danger
that may befall you.
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,032
In case someone's trying
to steal your bamboo sleeping mat...
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,134
or your kettle of fish?
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:06,502
It's one thing being prepared
for an attack against each other.
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:11,512
Whole other story being prepared for
an attack. I don't know.. Surprise!
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,849
You knew that was coming...
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:25,063
but that doesn't mean
you have unagi.
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:32,370
If we made reservations, we could have
unagi in a half-hour.
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:37,133
-Is Monica here?
-No.
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:40,801
I need help. I don't know
what to get for Valentine's Day.
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:45,814
Valentine's Day was two weeks ago,
so I wouldn't get her a calendar.
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:50,082
She was working,
so we're celebrating tonight.
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:54,419
Why don't you book a day for
both of you at those romantic spas?
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,993
That's actually a good idea.
00:04:57,263 --> 00:05:00,061
And, of course, crotchless panties.
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:05,563
As appealing as that sounds
to her boyfriend...
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,836
and her brother...
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,077
We promised to make
each other gifts this year.
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,611
-I love that.
-You guys!
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:18,176
You can't make crotchless panties?
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:21,613
You take scissors and cut..
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:22,878
Okay, okay, okay.
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,181
Making things sounds so much fun.
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:29,620
I thought so too, until I papier-mached
one of my eyes shut.
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:32,527
I love papier-mache!
What did you make?
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,630
I made a flar-lar-lar.
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:37,767
-What is that?
-Nothing!
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,401
So, what are you gonna do?
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:44,371
Have you made anything
I can take credit for?
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,102
I have, I have! I started making
little sock bunnies!
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:50,248
Oh, for crying out loud!
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,616
Wait a minute. That is my sock!
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,953
Now it's your little bunny friend.
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:09,963
Okay...
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,242
This actually is a flar-lar-lar.
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,875
Can I ask about the
Valentine's Day gifts?
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,608
-Yeah.
-Do we have to make the entire thing?
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:29,448
Yes. Did you forget to make yours?
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,413
Of course not.
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:37,585
I just have to go to the place
where I made it and pick it up.
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:42,034
I can't wait. It'll be
the best Valentine's Day ever!
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:47,368
I can't believe it!
Make the presents!
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,977
-What?
-Just so excited to make the presents!
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:02,514
Hi, I'm Joey Tribbiani.
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:05,620
With all due respect,
I'd like to donate some fluids.
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,020
We're at the end of a research cycle
and not looking for applicants now.
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:14,893
That's too bad. I've been saving up.
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:21,872
You sure there's no studies
I can participate in?
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:25,238
-Here's a schedule.
-Thanks.
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:27,709
This one starts now.
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,073
Only identical twins are eligible.
It's a twin study.
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:33,885
But it's $2000!
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,154
Sorry.
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:39,415
And this?
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:44,852
"Testing the Effects of Joey Tribbiani
on Attractive Nurse Receptionist."
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:49,733
Results are back on that one.
They're not good.
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:56,004
-That was good.
-Yeah.
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,609
Danger! Danger!
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:05,043
What the hell was that?
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:08,717
A lesson in the importance of unagi.
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,582
You're a freak!
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:15,853
Perhaps.
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,654
Now I'm curious.
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:23,928
At what point during those girlish
screams would you have kicked my ass?
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:29,135
All right, so we weren't prepared!
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,376
I'm sorry I had to take such drastic
measures to make my point.
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,445
I just want you to be safe.
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:39,479
Danger!
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:45,488
Ah-ha!
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,383
Unagi!
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,396
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,269
I wish I had a twin.
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:01,839
Where could I find someone...
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:04,804
who looks exactly like me?
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:28,190
Chandler.
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:32,201
I sensed it was you.
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:35,437
What?
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,672
Unagi.
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,269
I'm always aware.
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:43,471
Are you aware that unagi is an eel?
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:48,114
-What's up?
-I can't figure out what to make Monica.
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,687
Why don't you make her
one of your little jokes?
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:54,859
I'm going crazy.
Do you have anything homemade?
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:58,227
You know what?
She'd love this.
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:01,956
It's a replica of Apollo 8.
I made it in the sixth grade.
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:07,461
I could use that. I could say,
"Your love sends me to the moon."
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:10,574
Except Apollo 8 didn't
actually land on the moon.
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:15,873
You can say, "Your love lets me orbit
the moon twice and return safely."
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,642
I can't give this to her.
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,844
-Why not?
-It says "Captain Ross" on the side.
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,716
And it says "I hate Monica"
on the bottom.
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,162
Danger!
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:43,668
Salmon-skin roll.
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,360
Yes, honey, I made it myself.
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:22,571
I can't do it. I can't do it.
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:29,448
A mixed tape! A mixed tape!
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:33,717
Hi! Ready to exchange gifts?
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,951
-Sure. You go first.
-Okay, come here.
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:40,997
Okay, it's not wrapped
because I just finished it.
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:45,567
But I made you a tape of what I think
are all romantic songs.
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:48,930
What a great gift!
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:54,011
Is "The Way You Look Tonight" on it?
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,673
We'll have to listen and see.
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:02,349
Oh, I love it!
Thank you so much.
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:05,981
You ready to open yours?
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:19,866
It's a sock bunny.
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:22,774
Remember how I call you bunny?
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:25,108
Not really.
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:29,775
I did one time.
And I want to start doing it more.
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:33,115
-That's what this is about.
-I see.
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,684
Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:39,517
No, she doesn't.
What she makes, they're sock rabbits.
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:42,319
They're completely different.
Okay, okay.
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,356
I didn't make it!
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:48,363
I forgot about tonight and that we're
supposed to make the presents.
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:49,860
It's okay.
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:51,394
No, it's not okay.
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,296
You're so incredible.
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:57,406
You went through all this time
and effort to make this tape.
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:01,478
I'll make this up to you.
I will.
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:06,242
I am going to cook you
anything you want in here.
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:10,751
And I'm going to do anything
you want in there.
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:15,988
Well, I did put a lot of thought
into the tape.
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,003
You are way too young
to have seen that.
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:34,639
Your birthday's in a month and a half.
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,416
What if I forget to get you
a present for that too?
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:42,450
You are totally and completely
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,188
We've got to wash that.
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:53,328
Remember that jacket you loved
that was too expensive?
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,590
You have done enough.
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:58,299
I'll wake up early and get it.
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,665
No, you don't..
Get it in black, not brown.
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,033
Your cake is ready.
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:12,950
It's like that old saying,
"Have sex, eat some cake."
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,686
Hey, Mon. Hey, Chan.
Just getting a soda.
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,454
Who the hell are you?
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:27,727
I'm Joey.
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:30,793
How are you doing?
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:35,035
No! No! No! No! No!
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,031
How you doing?
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:42,340
How you doing?
Damn it, Carl! Go wait in the hall.
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,220
I've got to apologize
on behalf of Carl.
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:52,515
Who the hell is Carl?
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,521
Did I not mention?
00:14:55,761 --> 00:15:00,892
Carl is a guy I hired to be my twin
for a medical research project.
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,839
Sometimes the good ideas are
right in front of you.
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:13,177
It sounds crazy, but it might work.
The only problem is Carl's acting...
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,243
The only problem?
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:20,249
He's the reason I didn't get that big
commercial a couple of years ago.
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,716
We were supposed to be brothers,
but he messed up.
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,081
Can I get a piece of that cake?
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:29,254
Pizza! We like pizza!
Get out!
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:39,432
-Pat Sajak?
-Yep.
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,639
-Alex Trebek?
-Of course.
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:44,240
-Chuck Woolery?
-Definitely.
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:49,471
You will not find a single game-show
host whose ass I cannot kick.
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,289
-Say it!
-Say we are unagi!
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:05,956
It's not something you are,
it's something you have.
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:07,990
Say it!
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:09,928
I could easily get out of this...
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:14,071
but there's a chance
you could get very, very hurt!
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:30,987
Carl, we're next. Now remember,
what is this not gonna be?
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:34,123
-Another Minute Maid fiasco.
-That's right.
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:35,658
And what are you not gonna do?
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:39,491
-I'm not gonna talk because..
-Damn it, Carl!
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,767
Can I have the next one, please?
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:47,266
Thank you.
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,503
Joey and Tony Tribbiani.
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:51,204
That's us.
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:54,776
But this is a study
for identical twins.
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,881
That's right. $2000.
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:00,848
But you're not identical twins.
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,351
Damn it, Carl!
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:13,888
Oh, my good God.
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:19,903
Continuing the countdown of your
favorite meals.
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:23,072
Tonight, number three:
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:26,840
Macaroni and cheese
with cut-up hot dogs.
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:32,146
Look, you have done enough.
You have to stop this now.
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,375
I will, but not tonight.
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:38,716
For dinner music, I thought we could
listen to that tape that you made me.
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,716
Oh, the mixed tape.
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:52,103
"The Way You Look Tonight" is on here.
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:53,599
Dance with me.
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:15,357
You are just the sweetest.
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:22,694
I love the way you look every night,
Chandler.
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,597
That's why I made you this tape.
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:34,107
Happy birthday!
Love, Janice!
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:41,479
No, you're the sweetest.
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:50,588
Okay, ladies, that ends today's class.
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,388
Remember, be safe out there.
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,135
-Great class.
-Thanks.
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:03,271
I was watching.
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:09,437
A couple of questions:
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,343
You know that last move...
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:14,745
where that woman tripped you
and pinned you to the floor?
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,284
What would you do next?
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,922
She'd take the keys
and jam them in your..
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,127
No, no. What would you do next?
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:25,294
-Who, me, the attacker?
-Yes, that's right.
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,487
Why?
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:31,191
I tried attacking two women.
Did not work.
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,527
What?
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:35,001
No, it's okay.
They're my friends.
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:38,606
In fact, I was married to one of them.
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:42,113
You attacked your ex-wife?
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,179
Oh, no. No, no.
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,077
I tried.
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:51,282
But I couldn't.
That's why I'm here.
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,115
Maybe we could attack them together!
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,087
That's a no.
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:03,328
I am so, so, so, so sorry.
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:11,106
And I will cook
anything you want in here...
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:14,870
and do anything you want in there.
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:19,441
Yeah, you will!
And are you kidding me?
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,852
Come on, Monica,
it's our Valentine's Day.
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:27,182
Please, please, please, please?
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,550
Okay.
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:49,876
-So are we going in there?
-I am!
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,997
Nowhere to run.
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,964
I don't like sitting up here.
I'm gonna go over..
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,694
No, they got here first.
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:25,378
-Why is Ross doing that?
-Danger!
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:30,145
Oh, my God!
Why is he jumping on those women?
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,715
We should help them.
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:37,052
I don't think they need any help.
