00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:06,669
Did everything go okay
with the annulment?
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,238
No problems.
It's all taken care of.
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:10,670
Ross, thank you.
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,903
Want to go see a movie?
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:15,103
Yeah, why not?
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:16,805
I'll get my sweater.
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:21,811
Want to hear something weird?
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,319
Always.
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:27,084
I didn't get the annulment.
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:29,420
What?
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:31,028
We're still married.
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,492
Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,831
Do you have any gum?
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,777
Wait! Wait! Ross, can I just
talk to you for just a second?
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:47,707
We'll be late for the movie.
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:49,777
There's a cab. Taxi!
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:52,109
That's great.
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:54,946
What timing! My God, huh?
There you go.
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:58,350
We're gonna walk.
It's right at the Angelika.
00:00:58,625 --> 00:00:59,990
The Angelika! Go! Go!
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:04,024
You didn't get the annulment?!
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,891
I know.
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:10,868
I tried, but when I got to
my lawyer's office, all I heard was:
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,596
"Three divorces! Three divorces!"
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:17,072
Yes, in that high voice.
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:21,805
I just don't want my tombstone to read:
"Ross Geller: Three Divorces."
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:25,643
Don't worry about that. Your tombstone
can say whatever you want.
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:28,581
It can say,
"Ross Geller: Good at Marriage."
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:33,956
You know? Mine's gonna say,
"Phoebe Buffay: Buried Alive."
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:38,053
All I know is, I can't have
another failed marriage.
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:42,166
So you're gonna be married to
a girl who doesn't even know about it?
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,232
Woman. Sorry.
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:49,241
Okay, so I don't have it all
worked out quite yet.
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,841
Just don't say anything to Rachel.
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,070
Rachel is one of my closest friends.
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:59,479
But being the only one that knows
about this makes me feel special. Okay.
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,923
Okay, stop, stop! Phoebe?
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,524
Hey, Rach!
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,252
What was that?
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,088
Sorry. Mix-up.
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:13,495
How was the movie?
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:16,098
I haven't seen it yet.
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,463
You'd better hurry.
The Angelika! Go!
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,100
The One Where Ross Hugs Rachel
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,283
When I move in,
can I get a gumball machine?
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:08,453
Of course. Joey wouldn't
let you have one?
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:12,020
No, when it comes to sweets,
he's surprisingly strict.
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,119
Did you tell him you're moving out?
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:18,694
No, I keep trying.
And I can get out, "Joey, I have to.."
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:22,868
Then I lose my nerve and I finish
with, "go to the bathroom."
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:24,936
He may think I'm sick.
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:29,399
I have to tell Rachel, but...
We just gotta get it over with.
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:32,806
Next time we see them,
we'll just tell them. That's it.
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,209
That's how it'll work now?
You'll just order me around?
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,948
-Pretty much.
-All right.
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:43,118
Hey, man, you feeling better?
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:49,755
We have something to tell you.
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:52,059
Oh, my God!
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:53,993
You're pregnant!
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:57,295
No!
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,941
Look, Joe, here's the thing.
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:08,744
Monica and I have decided
to live together, here.
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,607
I'm gonna be moving out, man.
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:23,122
I'm really happy for you guys.
Congratulations. See you later.
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:25,255
Are you okay?
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,933
I gotta go. I've got an acting job.
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,331
Like you'd believe that.
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,366
This sucks!
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:37,502
I'll be across the hall.
And I promise you...
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,271
the minute Monica and I break up,
I'm moving right back in.
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,748
Maybe that's now.
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,276
If you're gonna move in with him...
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,854
I feel it is my responsibility
to tell you the truth about him.
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:53,250
He's a terrible roommate. Terrible.
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,188
He forgets to...
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,490
He always, he always...
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,533
Who am I kidding?
He's the best roommate!
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,704
-Hey, Phoebe.
-Hey.
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:12,606
Oh, look, here's an article about people
who marry people and don't tell them.
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:16,306
-Really?
-Yeah, I'm reading Ross Geller Magazine.
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:19,607
Have you seen Rachel?
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,016
-No, why?
-I have some exciting news.
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:23,682
You're pregnant.
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,548
No!
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,458
Chandler and I are moving in together.
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,254
Oh, that's good!
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:35,195
But if you were pregnant,
what would you name it? Hint, Phoebe.
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,369
What's up?
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:44,742
Chandler and I are moving in together.
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:47,105
Oh, my God.
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:50,974
Oh, my little sister
and my best friend...
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,808
shacking up.
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,818
That's great. That's great.
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,923
Guys, I'm happy too.
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:00,624
Okay, come here.
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:06,223
Big day, huh? People moving in.
People getting annulled.
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,267
I gotta go find Rachel.
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:15,838
If you see her, give her some really
bad news, so mine doesn't seem so bad.
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:21,610
Something bad to tell Rachel.
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,816
Bad news for Rachel.
What could that be?
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:29,350
Can you just lay off, please?
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:34,150
My life is an embarrassment. I should
just go live under somebody's stairs.
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:38,452
It's not that big a deal.
You'll have been divorced three times.
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,757
You'll have a life, you'll date..
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:45,165
No, I won't. I'll be at the bottom
of the dating barrel now.
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:48,168
The only guys below me
will be Four-Divorce Guy...
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,432
Murderer Guy...
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:52,337
and geologists.
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:57,706
Ross, you're being ridiculous.
You are cute and smart and sweet.
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:01,112
That is much more important
than three stupid divorces.
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:04,346
Have you dated anyone
who's been divorced three times?
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:08,891
That's not fair. Most guys that have
been divorced three times are 60.
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,393
You're young.
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,793
That's true, I am young.
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:17,833
Well...
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,296
Nobody cares about this except you.
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:24,840
This embarrassment thing is
all in your head.
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:28,575
-Here, I'll show you. Come here.
-What?
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:32,944
Hi. My friend Ross is about to be
divorced for the third time.
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,676
But wouldn't you date him?
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,947
And if you wait right here,
I'll go get Ross.
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:45,090
Thought you were Rachel.
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:47,362
What gave me away?
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,195
I gotta tell her.
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,632
I told Ross and Phoebe.
She's the only one left.
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:54,465
It's official.
We're moving in together.
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,073
No turning back.
Are you scared? Are you?!
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:00,302
No.
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,639
That was my scariest voice.
You're brave.
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:08,645
The worst day.
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:13,483
You're finally making progress at work,
then your boss calls you Racquel.
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:18,823
Listen, for the first four years
of my work, everybody called me...
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,162
-Seriously.
-I believe you.
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:32,608
It was in the middle of a meeting,
so no one wants to correct her.
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,507
So everyone's calling me Racquel.
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,443
By the end of the day, the mailroom
guys were calling me Rocky.
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:43,646
Well, I still think you're
very, very nice and very pretty.
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:45,681
What?
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:48,916
All yours, babe.
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:52,955
Have a seat.
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,333
Listen, Chandler and I...
00:08:58,104 --> 00:08:59,969
are going to live together.
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,330
Here.
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:05,837
Oh, my God.
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,870
That's so great!
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:13,016
I'm so happy for you guys!
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,311
Really?
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,884
And that was so sweet of you to ask.
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:21,025
The three of us are gonna have
such a good time living together!
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:23,954
Yes, we are.
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:28,228
Chandler, you'll have to watch
those long showers you take...
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:31,402
because you know
Racquel can't be late.
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,401
He'll work on that.
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,873
This is so exciting!
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,345
Come and knock on our door
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:47,744
We'll be waiting for you
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,052
See? Once you know the stories,
it's not that bad.
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:00,824
First marriage: Wife's hidden
sexuality. Not my fault.
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,936
Second marriage:
Said the wrong name at the altar.
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:06,898
A little my fault.
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:11,268
Third marriage: They shouldn't
let you get married...
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:13,910
when you're drunk
and have writing on your face.
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,671
Nevada's fault.
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:21,175
So what do you think, ladies?
Who wouldn't want to date him?
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,852
The divorces don't bother me.
I'd date him.
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,590
But not while he's still married.
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:27,849
And you, wouldn't you want to date?
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,062
I'm not dating at all anymore.
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,890
I was only dating guys
that were bad for me.
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,599
So I decided that..
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,199
Good. Good. Whatever.
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,594
And you, Meg?
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,602
Well, I don't care about
the divorces, either.
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,968
But I wouldn't date him.
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,943
Normally, he doesn't sweat this much.
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:51,877
It's just that he's obviously
still in love with this Rachel girl.
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,244
What?
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:57,014
She said, "He's obviously still
in love with this Rachel girl."
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:03,192
This is crazy. I mean, yes,
Rachel is my good friend.
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:06,057
And I have loved her in the past...
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:08,596
but now, she is just my wife.
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:13,030
Phoebe, will you help me out here?
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:16,265
Well, I thought you loved her
when you married her.
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:20,945
We were drunk! I would've married
Joey with that amount of alcohol.
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:24,643
You could do a lot worse
than Joey Tribbiani!
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,984
I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong.
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:32,452
I just don't want
to be divorced three times.
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:34,956
Now he's using
this three-divorces reason...
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:38,458
because he wants to stay married
to her because he loves her.
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:41,165
I must say, well done. Bravo, Meg.
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:45,827
Fine. If this is what you think,
forget about...
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,596
the whole three-divorce thing.
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:52,141
I'll go to my lawyer's office right now
and get this marriage annulled.
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,005
She means nothing to me.
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,145
Nothing!
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:01,749
Okay, now I wouldn't date you
because you seem a little creepy.
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,349
I am so attracted to him right now.
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:12,595
When will we tell Rachel
what actually will happen?
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:13,754
Soon.
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:16,799
I just couldn't before.
You saw how upset Joey got.
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:19,334
I couldn't do it.
She's my best friend.
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:21,028
Joey's my best friend.
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,866
I'm not your best friend?
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:26,608
You just said..
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,339
Of course you're my best friend.
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,545
Would you tell Rachel?
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,949
All right. At least I'm prepared.
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:39,055
Oh, yes.
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,790
-They're not for you. Are you upset?
-I am now.
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,132
Hey, roomie.
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,195
Okay, bye.
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:58,836
There's something important
I have to tell you.
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:00,341
Are you pregnant?
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,480
No, but I'm throwing this shirt away.
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:08,482
I think there was a little
misunderstanding before.
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:14,082
When I said that Chandler and I
wanted to live together...
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,529
we meant alone together.
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:24,730
Oh, my God. That's funny.
I can't believe I did that.
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,700
No, sweetie. You know what?
This is my fault.
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,534
I wasn't clear.
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,767
I'm really sorry.
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:35,947
Listen, you take as much time
as you need to move out, okay?
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:37,911
There's absolutely no rush.
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:40,380
Okay.
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:48,917
Don't you want a cookie?
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,022
Sure.
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:54,624
Thanks.
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,232
Do you need a tissue?
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,797
-Where did you get these?
-I made them.
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:05,738
Oh, God, they're so yummy!
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,275
-Okay, whose is this?
-That's mine.
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,782
-And what about this? Whose is this?
-That's mine.
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:17,218
Okay, whose dishwashing soap is this?
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:20,722
That was here when we moved in.
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:25,294
Oh, I guess it really is concentrated.
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:31,491
It's gonna be weird when I come home
and you're not here.
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,533
No more Joey and Chan's.
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,967
No more J and C's.
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,640
Want to go to Joey and Chandler's?
Can't. It's not there.
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:43,980
I'll be across the hall.
We can still do all the same stuff.
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:47,049
We won't be able to have
those long talks at night...
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,221
about our feelings and the future.
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:51,846
Not once did we do that.
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:56,723
Don't you remember that night,
it was late and I was feeling sick...
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:01,890
and you said
I would feel better tomorrow?
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,762
Oh, yeah. I remember that.
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:08,034
I don't know.
I'm just gonna miss living with you.
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,232
Yeah, me too, man.
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,903
-What the hell is that?
-That's disgusting.
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:20,610
I told Rachel that it's just
gonna be the two of us.
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:23,184
Oh, yeah? Well, how'd she take it?
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:24,950
Really well.
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,282
Surprisingly well.
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:30,790
She didn't cry.
She wasn't angry or sad.
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:37,135
And you're upset because you
didn't make your best friend cry?
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,269
All I'm asking for is
a little emotion.
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,599
Is that too much to ask
after six years?
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,605
What, are Rachel and I
not as close as you guys?
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:49,941
I mean, did we not have as much fun?
Don't I deserve a few tears?
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:53,374
When we told Joey,
he cried his eyes out.
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,381
I did not cry my eyes out!
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,084
Come on, it's like the end of an era.
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,226
No more J-Man and Channy's!
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:06,459
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,300
You got married again?
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:17,432
Yes.
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:21,836
So that's your second marriage
in two years?
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:24,412
Yes. Second in two years.
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,982
Third, overall.
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:30,483
I have been a divorce attorney
for 23 years...
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:33,816
and never have I had
so much business from one client.
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:38,594
Why don't you tell me what happened?
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:43,298
Basically, Rachel and I were
in Vegas, and we got drunk.
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,869
I'm sorry, is this the same Rachel
whose name you said...
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,970
at the altar
in the second marriage?
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,869
Yes, yes, yes.
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:53,176
But I do not love her.
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,307
That's better then.
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:01,219
This was just a drunken mistake,
and I need to get it annulled.
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:02,545
I see.
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:05,649
Have you considered therapy?
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:11,359
I think just the annulment for today.
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:13,961
-There are some forms to fill out.
-Easy.
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:18,636
We'll need witnesses who can testify
that you were not of sound mind.
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:20,702
No problem.
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:24,136
We'll need you and Rachel
to testify before a judge.
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,077
There's no way to do this without her?
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:34,217
Because I kind of already told her
it was taken care of.
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,411
Of course you did.
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:42,692
Look, you can't get an annulment
unless you and Rachel are both there.
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,658
What about someone
who looks like Rachel?
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,202
I will think about the therapy.
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:03,245
So I was thinking that maybe we
should start dividing up our stuff.
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:05,348
Okay.
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,783
No point in dragging it out.
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:11,515
Dragging out the long process
of you moving out...
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:13,850
and us not living together anymore.
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,458
What about this? Who gets this?
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:27,433
I don't know if I want it because
it might be too many memories.
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,632
-What is that?
-I don't know.
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:37,046
How about this?
I want you to have the big plate.
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:41,314
Wow, Monica, thanks.
I love this plate.
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,450
Something to remember me by.
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:48,385
Mon, you're not dying.
I'm just moving out.
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,819
We're gonna see each other
all the time.
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,997
But still, it's a big change.
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:58,430
The end of an era, you might say.
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,171
Are you okay? You're not blinking.
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:08,573
I'm fine. I was thinking about
how it's an end of an era.
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:10,606
Oh, all right.
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:16,648
But I gotta say, I don't think
six years counts as an era.
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:19,788
An era is defined as
a significant period of time.
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:23,426
It was significant for me.
Maybe it wasn't significant to you!
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:27,030
-What is the matter with you?
-What is the matter with you?!
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,025
Why aren't you more upset?
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:33,328
Aren't you gonna be sad
that we're not living together?
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,539
Aren't you gonna miss me at all?
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:38,707
Monica, all right.
But don't get mad at me.
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:43,039
It's just a little hard to believe.
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:45,214
What's hard to believe?
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:49,648
I mean, it's you guys.
You do this kind of stuff, you know?
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:53,951
You were gonna get married in Vegas,
and then you backed out.
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:58,630
I'm not upset because I don't see you
going through with it. I'm sorry.
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:06,704
It's going to happen.
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:08,537
Chandler will move in here.
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,641
-But I..
-I know, just let me finish, okay?
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:16,344
This isn't something that we just
impulsively decided to do in Vegas.
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,073
This is something
that we both really want.
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,252
And it is going to happen.
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:25,488
It is?
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:28,990
Really?
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,089
Yeah, sweetie.
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:36,766
You mean, we're not gonna
live together anymore?
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:45,205
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna miss you so much.
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,207
I'm gonna miss you.
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,108
I mean, it's the end of an era!
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:51,872
I know!
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,754
-Okay, bye.
-Oh, no.
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,755
So did you get the annulment?
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:04,087
-I couldn't.
-I knew it. Because you love Rachel.
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:07,865
It's not that.
Annulments are more complicated..
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:10,296
Complicated because of the love.
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,363
I do not love Rachel.
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,539
I'm telling her
about the whole thing...
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:19,039
so we can get this marriage
annulled as fast as possible.
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,212
Would I do that if I loved her?
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:24,405
I've never been more convinced
of your love for her.
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:28,879
I do not have feelings
for Rachel, okay?
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:34,423
Oh, what's wrong?
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,653
Monica and Chandler are
moving in here...
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:40,625
and I have to move out
and everything is changing.
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:44,324
Oh, my God, come here, come here.
It's okay.
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,833
Everything's gonna be okay.
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:50,131
-Thank you.
-Of course.
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:03,351
So Ross and Rachel got married.
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:06,346
Monica and Chandler
almost got married.
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:08,450
You think we should hook up?
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:11,790
Oh, we do.
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,497
But not just yet.
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:16,959
Really? Well, when?
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:22,906
Well, first Chandler and Monica
will get married...
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,403
and be filthy rich, by the way.
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,134
But it won't work out.
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:28,971
I know.
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:32,916
Then I'll marry Chandler
for the money.
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,586
And you'll marry Rachel
and have the beautiful kids.
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,153
Great.
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,324
But then we ditch them
and we get married.
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:44,553
We'll have Chandler's money
and Rachel's kids.
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:48,766
Getting custody will be easy
because of Rachel's drinking problem.
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:51,160
What about Ross?
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,497
I don't want to go
into the whole thing.
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:55,672
But we have words and I kill him.
