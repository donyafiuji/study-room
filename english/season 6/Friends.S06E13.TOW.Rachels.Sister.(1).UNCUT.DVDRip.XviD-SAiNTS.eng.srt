00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:05,300
Okay, Rach, that's muffin
and espresso, $4.50.
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:09,998
Ross, double latte, $2.75.
Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25.
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:12,643
And Phoebe, herbal tea, $1.25.
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:15,540
All together that's $12.75.
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:20,147
This coming from the man who couldn't
split our $80 phone bill in half.
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:23,580
How much do I owe you?
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,987
That's on the house,
courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:30,126
Great. Well, tell him thanks.
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:33,423
And since Joey seems like
such a nice guy...
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,133
maybe we could go out?
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:37,893
He's not used to women
being so forward...
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:41,004
but I could check with him.
He says it's okay.
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,139
Great. Thanks. Bye-bye.
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:47,646
How come our stuff isn't free?
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:51,112
It will be when you look like
that in a tight skirt.
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:53,643
I'm getting more dates than ever.
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:56,822
You're only giving free stuff
to the pretty girls?
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,990
Joey, that is so gross!
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,091
How about a scone on the house, baby?
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:05,257
I'm pretty.
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:09,601
The One With Rachel's Sister
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:48,571
-Hey, does anyone have any gum?
-I do.
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:52,936
Here. Sorry.
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,712
Oh, you know what?
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,611
No.
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,554
Wait a second.
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:11,797
-I know it's in here.
-You know what? I'm good.
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,296
Sorry, I guess it's in my big bag.
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:19,197
Say, does anybody have a goldfish?
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:25,408
Why are you here?
Shouldn't you be at work?
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,740
They sent me home.
They said I can't work if I'm sick.
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,209
-Sorry you're sick.
-I'm not sick!
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:38,591
I don't get sick. Getting sick is
for weaklings, it's for pansies.
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,919
No one thinks that you're a pansy...
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,960
but we do think
that you need a tissue.
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:50,831
I have not been sick
in over three years.
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:55,569
I think you're sick because
that used to be in your nose.
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,304
I'll get tissue.
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,673
I don't need a tissue. I'm fine-d.
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:05,442
When you put a D
at the end of fine...
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,777
you're not fine.
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,612
I'm fine-d.
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,783
I'm fine-d.
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:17,195
It's a really hard word to say.
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:33,071
-Yes?
-Hi. Is Rachel here? I'm her sister.
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,473
Oh, my God, Jill!
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,609
Oh, my God, Rachel!
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:39,711
Oh, my God, introduce us.
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:43,449
This is Chandler.
And you know Monica and Ross.
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,924
And that's Phoebe.
And that's Joey.
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,916
-How you doing?
-Don't!
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,426
Honey, what are you doing here?
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:56,795
Which sister is this?
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,005
Is this the spoiled one
or the one that bit her?
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,467
Daddy cut me off.
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,266
Never mind, I got it.
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:05,175
You know what I said?
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,846
I said, "I'll hire a lawyer,
sue you, take all your money...
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,572
and cut you off!"
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,250
Wow. What did he say?
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,248
That he wouldn't pay
for my lawyer.
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:18,156
Then he told me to learn
the value of money...
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,949
from the one daughter
he's actually proud of.
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:25,593
Did you hear that?
My dad's proud of me.
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,264
My dad's proud of me.
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:29,761
-Rach?
-Oh, yeah. Sorry.
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:33,370
Honey, so what did you do
that made Dad cut you off?
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:35,774
Okay, I bought a boat.
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,475
You bought a boat?
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:40,169
It wasn't for me,
it was for a friend.
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,048
Boy, did we make friends
with the wrong sister.
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:48,683
I knew it was stupid and
I shouldn't have done it...
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:52,018
but she bought me all these CDs
and said I had a cute haircut.
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,626
And your daddy didn't understand?
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:59,891
I know, and usually I just cry
and say I'm sorry and he forgives me.
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:03,934
Oh, yes, good criers, the Green girls.
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,734
I mean, the Green sisters.
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:13,610
Man, no matter how you say it...
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,409
it still sounds like you're
talking about green people.
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,912
I'm at rock bottom.
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:25,285
This is the best thing that
could've happened to you.
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:27,684
You've needed to get out on your own.
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:31,920
When I did it, at first I was scared,
but then look at me now.
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:35,429
I am the only daughter
that Dad is proud of.
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,033
I can't believe him.
How does he expect me to buy stuff?
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:43,198
Maybe, you know, you
won't buy stuff for a while.
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,310
I don't understand.
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:48,975
This is what you'll do.
You're gonna get a job.
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:51,082
You're gonna get an apartment.
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,481
And then you will live off
the money that you earn.
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:57,521
Okay, I know this is what you did...
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,920
but that doesn't sound like me.
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,052
Okay, but it can be. It can be you.
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:06,255
And you can stay with us.
Right, Phoebe?
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:09,026
-Of course, yeah.
-Oh, that's so great!
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:12,863
Okay, I'm really gonna do this.
I don't know how to thank you.
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:15,233
Oh, I like cars.
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:22,971
-You all finished?
-Yes.
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:24,648
Great.
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,922
Okay, here are the tips
for this morning.
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:35,183
Jen gets 50, 50 for me
and Joey owes 8 dollars.
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,024
-What?
-For all the free food you gave away.
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,167
If it's free, how come
you're charging me for it?
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:46,336
We don't give anything away
unless it's a birthday.
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:50,032
What if they came in third
in a modeling contest?
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,299
No.
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:53,909
Sorry.
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,145
I just had the hardest day.
Some of these are so heavy.
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:05,688
How did you pay? I thought
your dad took your credit card.
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,485
I memorized those numbers
when I was 15.
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:12,898
But look at all the cool
make-it-on-my-own stuff I got!
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,067
This is my "Please hire me" sweater.
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:20,362
And these are my "Don't you want
to rent me this apartment?" pants.
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:26,208
Charging clothes to your dad doesn't
qualify as making it on your own.
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,571
Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get
all technical.
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:33,041
Rachel's not gonna think
it's a good idea.
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:37,345
-So who made her queen of the world?
-I would love that job!
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,191
What's going on?
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,928
Jill!
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,363
Did you shop?
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,565
No.
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,960
They did.
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,297
Yeah, we went shopping!
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,272
You went shopping?
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,639
Then you came here
and paraded it under Jill's nose...
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:02,642
when you know she's trying to quit.
That's terrible.
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:05,148
Sorry, Jill.
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:08,784
So, what'd you get?
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:11,319
Oh, well, all right. Thank you.
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:15,288
I got this, you know,
"I want a job" sweater.
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:21,497
And then I got..
These are apartment pants.
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:24,627
Apartment pants?
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,571
You've never heard of them?
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,565
Of course I've heard of them.
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,638
Ross, what'd you get?
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,278
I got this...
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,849
This.
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:43,785
-A pashmina?
-Yeah!
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,259
I love these babies.
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:53,355
Really?
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:54,827
What's a pashmina?
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:57,764
It's a rug.
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:00,996
Jill?
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,902
I'm sorry, Rachel.
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:09,814
You think that's gonna work on me?
I invented that.
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,278
Right! But I am sorry.
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,948
It's okay.
One little setback is okay.
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,556
-But don't let it happen again, okay?
-Okay.
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:25,127
Now, since Daddy paid for all this
stuff, I should take it all away.
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:28,528
But I'm just gonna take the pashmina.
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:33,066
And the pants.
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,570
I'll take it all, because that way,
you'll learn the lesson.
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,708
Alrighty.
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:43,678
I'm gonna run a couple of errands
and I will see you at dinner.
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,920
She took all my stuff.
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:53,818
Yeah. Everything but
the little blue one.
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,357
That's the best one!
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:58,155
Oh, my God. Thank you so much!
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,229
Well, hey.
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,458
Oh, my gosh, that was so lame.
Like a pashmina could be a rug.
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,367
Oh, yeah? How about you
with the "I'm sorry"?
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,735
Shut up! I wasn't like that at all.
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:15,107
What about what I said about
the apartment pants? How dumb was l?
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,548
-Were you this cute in high school?
-Oh, stop.
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:24,222
-No, you stop.
-No, you stop.
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,751
Why don't I sit here
and then you'll both stop it?
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,097
Okay. So, what do you want to do?
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,699
Let's do something crazy.
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:38,927
I know, let's rest and drink
lots of fluids.
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:41,437
Okay, I'll rest.
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:46,203
But if I'm going to bed,
then you're coming with me.
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:51,644
See, that would be impossible
to resist if you weren't all...
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,282
drippy here.
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:59,623
Are you saying that you don't
want to get with this?
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,293
I don't think you should say that
even when you're healthy.
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:11,894
Come on.
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,837
Don't take this personally.
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:18,805
I just can't have sex
with a sick person.
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:24,173
I'm with you. I can't have sex with
a sick person either. Disgusting!
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,509
But I'm not sick!
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,942
Let me prove it to you.
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:33,948
We are two healthy people
in the prime of lime.
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:39,287
See, that's the thing, I would like
to stay in the "prime of lime."
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:48,273
Oh, okay, now I'll do it.
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:54,003
Hey. What's up?
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:57,806
I think there's something
you should know.
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,678
Better not be about
the apartment pants.
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:05,085
I just pitched the idea to my boss
at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,121
No. It's just, I was...
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,487
I was with Ross and Jill
after you left...
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:13,995
and I'm pretty sure I saw
a little spark between them.
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,033
-What?
-I mean, it's probably nothing.
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,569
But I wanted to warn you
that there might be something.
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,835
-With Ross and Jill?
-Yeah.
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,374
With Ross and my sister?
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,577
With my sister Jill
and my ex-boyfriend Ross?
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,787
-Oh, there is no way.
-Okay, then.
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:38,923
Oh, my God! I cannot believe that!
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:42,527
I don't like it when he dates anyone,
but my sister?
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,753
Isn't that incest or something?
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:47,866
And they're gonna have sex.
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,335
Oh, no! What if he marries her too?
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:54,062
This is just terrible.
This is just terrible.
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,673
And I can't stop it.
I don't own Ross.
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,845
And Jill should be able to do
what she wants to do.
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,015
Oh, my God, I can't believe Ross
is marrying my little sister.
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,515
This is the worst thing that
could've ever happened to me.
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:12,122
But great news about
the apartment pants, huh?
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,085
That'll be $3.85.
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:19,229
What? Yesterday you said
I was too pretty to pay.
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,963
It's just, I can't,
because my manager said that I..
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,767
Happy birthday to you
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,271
Happy birthday to you
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,411
-Happy birthday, dear Annie..
-Amy!
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,773
Amy
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:38,243
Happy birthday to you
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,384
That's weird,
today's my birthday too.
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:43,452
Not in here, it isn't.
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,789
Sorry I'm late. What's up?
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:55,259
I just wanted to see if there were
any leads on the old job front.
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:58,561
No. But I walked past three sales
and didn't go in.
00:13:58,804 --> 00:13:59,998
How strong am I?
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:02,938
That is great.
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:06,575
You know who doesn't have to
job-hunt? Ross.
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,178
-He works at the university.
-Yeah?
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:13,246
So you guys talked? So you get along?
So you're gonna go out?
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,849
Me go out with Ross? No.
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,524
God, no.
What would make you think that?
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,252
Phoebe...
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:25,759
said she thought she saw something
between you guys.
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,761
I mean, he's nice.
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,458
He's the kind you're friends with,
but not the kind you date.
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,299
He's the kind you date,
because you did. But me?
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,440
Not so much.
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:43,881
Oh, not so much. What do you mean?
Is there something wrong with Ross?
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:45,844
No, no, no. He's just...
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:48,985
I don't know.
You know, he's just a little bookish.
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:51,847
Are you saying he's a geek?
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:53,682
You think so too?
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:57,025
No. Ross is not a geek.
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,127
Then let's just say
he's not my type.
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:02,857
Handsome is not your type?
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:04,830
Smart, kind, good kisser.
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,232
What, those things aren't
on your list?
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:10,169
Ross is great.
You'd be lucky to be with him.
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:13,236
If it means that much,
then I'll ask him out.
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:16,037
Oh, no. That's not what I meant.
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,010
You know what? You're right.
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,548
He has been really nice to me.
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,211
Yeah, but he's not your type.
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,388
But maybe that's good.
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,684
I'm doing all these different things.
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,862
Maybe I should just try
dating a geek too.
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,730
Yeah, but you don't want
to try too much too fast.
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:39,928
You remember what happened
to the little girl who...
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:42,230
tried too much too fast, don't you?
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:45,001
What?
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,009
She died, Jill.
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,313
Chandler!
00:15:57,556 --> 00:16:00,992
What is it, honey?
You need some tea? Some soup?
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,894
Calling Dr. Big.
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,363
Dr. Big to the bed.
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:15,703
Jeez, honey,
I thought you were asleep.
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:20,637
How could I be asleep knowing
that you were in the next room?
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,509
I was asleep.
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:31,287
No, honey. You know what's sexy?
Layers.
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,289
Layers are sexy.
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:37,154
And blankets are sexy.
And hot-water bottles are sexy.
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:40,024
Get into bed.
I want to prove I'm not sick.
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:43,968
I want to make you feel
as good as I feel.
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,696
Would you please get some rest?
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:49,567
I'm fine.
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,240
-You're coughing.
-No, I'm not.
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,447
No, I'm not, I'm laughing.
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:04,081
-At what?
-Just something I heard before.
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:09,819
-Tell me.
-No, I don't want it to spoil the mood.
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:18,127
Happy birthday to you
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,808
-You're paying for that.
-No, it's her birthday.
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,739
You've sung "Happy Birthday"
to 20 women today.
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:32,174
You are no longer authorized
to distribute birthday muffins.
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:34,418
Damn it!
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,989
Did you tell your sister
to ask me out?
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:46,862
-Well, yeah.
-Oh, wow! I mean, wow.
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:51,130
I think she's cute, but...
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,601
I never would've thought of
going out with her. Never!
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:56,265
Really?
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,807
But after you said it's okay,
I figured, "Why not?"
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,840
Oh, so not really "never."
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:06,842
I have to say you are
a much bigger person than I am.
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,713
I mean, after all we've been through.
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:12,385
I wish I had a brother
to reciprocate.
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:17,461
If you ever date Monica,
you have my blessing.
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,187
And mine.
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,192
Chandler?
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,736
I think I'm sick.
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,028
Really?
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,331
Struck down in the "pribe of libe."
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:36,580
Okay, fine, I admit it.
I feel terrible.
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,248
Will you please rub this on my chest?
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:44,016
No, no, no.
You are not getting me this way.
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:47,589
Come on, I really need your help here.
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:53,021
-Fine, I'll rub it on myself.
-Okay.
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:16,013
So you're just kind of
rubbing it on yourself?
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:20,787
-Yeah.
-It's nice.
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,860
You kidding me?
Is this turning you on?
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,595
Yes.
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:30,567
Is it the rubbing or the smell?
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:33,360
It's all very, very good.
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:39,609
So you want to go...
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,872
mix it up?
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,551
-Not now, I'm sick.
-Oh, come on, you big faker!
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:52,053
What about never sleeping
with sick people?
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:56,417
Well, that was before
all the vaporizing action.
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,721
Okay, if you really
want to have sex.
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:05,169
Worked like a charm.
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:12,666
Why are you here?
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:17,478
This is where Ross and I are meeting
for our date. So, what do you think?
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:20,242
I don't like it.
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:24,783
-Really?
-It's kind of slutty.
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,815
It's yours.
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,860
Yeah, well, I'm a slut.
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:34,760
Me too.
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:39,968
Hi, Jill.
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,469
Hi...
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,007
Rachel.
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:49,203
You're not at home,
you're right here.
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:50,873
Yeah, I know.
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:55,313
And I bet you thought it would
be weird. But it's not.
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:02,125
Okay.
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:05,054
So, well, I'll...
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,321
I'll have her home by midnight.
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,653
Why aren't you home yet?
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,980
Is someone there?
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:35,355
Oh, yeah, it's me. Sorry.
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:37,759
What are you doing here?
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,927
I'm just looking out your window...
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,565
at the view.
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,334
What are you guys doing?
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:50,535
We got some vapor rub in some places.
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:57,343
He brought her back to his apartment.
00:21:58,417 --> 00:21:59,679
Who?
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:05,450
Is that your sister?
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:09,057
She is a slut!
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:13,598
Ross is on a date with your sister.
How weird is that?
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:16,366
Oh, my God, he's taking off
her clothes!
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,963
He's taking off her coat.
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:21,432
Oh, this is just terrible.
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,773
Oh, no, it's not. It's a first date.
I'm sure that nothing is gonna...
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:35,310
He's gonna get some.
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:39,921
Of the glare...
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:43,053
from the streetlight
out of his apartment.
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:47,225
You know, so he's closed
the drapes there...
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:50,230
so he can have a nice, pleasant...
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:53,302
conversation with
your little sister.
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:55,664
Well, I'm off to bed.
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:08,749
I don't feel good.
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:12,018
You better not get me sick.
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:21,724
I need some fruit
or some juice or some....
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:26,168
Or some nothing.
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,465
There's nothing in here.
Who took our food?
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:33,600
Can I interest you in a slice
of lasagna or a drumstick?
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:36,873
-No, thanks.
-Are you sure? It's on the house.
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:39,710
-No, thanks.
-How about going out with me Friday night?
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:42,479
-No, thanks.
-What are you gonna do.
