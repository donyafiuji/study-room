Hi!
00:00:03,752 --> 00:00:05,474
- Hey!
- You come back!
00:00:05,475 --> 00:00:06,718
How is the honeymoon?
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:08,441
Oh, incredible!
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:14,565
Oh, champagne, candle at dinner and
moonlight walks on the beach, so romantic!
00:00:14,852 --> 00:00:15,808
So, where's Mike?
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:20,306
Oh, he's at the doctor's,
he didn't poop the whole time we were there.
00:00:21,264 --> 00:00:23,082
Well, anyway, I'm glad you're back.
I really need your help.
00:00:23,082 --> 00:00:23,943
Oh, why? What's up?
00:00:23,943 --> 00:00:27,387
Well, I have an audition for this play and
for some of them would have to speak French,
00:00:27,388 --> 00:00:30,832
which according to my resume, I'm fluent in.
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:33,129
Joey, you shouldn't lie on your resume.
00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:35,138
Yeah, you really shouldn't!
00:00:35,139 --> 00:00:38,966
BTW, how was that year-long dig in Cairo?
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:42,220
It was ok.
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,133
I did not know you spoke French.
00:00:47,866 --> 00:00:50,736
Oh, you're so sexy.
00:00:50,928 --> 00:00:52,746
Well, so will you help me?
I really wanna be in this play.
00:00:52,746 --> 00:00:55,999
Sure.
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,966
Seriously, stop or I'm gonna jump on you.

Hey. Why are you wearing my apron?
00:01:43,415 --> 00:01:44,852
I'm making cookies for Erica.
00:01:44,852 --> 00:01:47,726
Oh, btw, we have to leave for the airport soon.
Her plane comes in ahout an hour.
00:01:47,727 --> 00:01:55,104
Oh hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as my wife and the woman who's carrying my child?
00:01:55,104 --> 00:01:56,636
No?
00:01:57,021 --> 00:01:59,320
Divorce?
00:02:00,278 --> 00:02:02,960
Hey. Do you guys know where Rachel is?
00:02:02,961 --> 00:02:04,493
No, we haven't seen her since this morning.
00:02:04,494 --> 00:02:08,039
Unbelievable! She was supposed to meet me
half an hour ago with Emma.
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,380
Hey!
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,721
These are for Erica!
00:02:10,722 --> 00:02:13,213
Well, is she gonna eat all those cookies?
00:02:13,213 --> 00:02:17,045
I want the baby to come out all cute and fat.
00:02:18,195 --> 00:02:19,727
So why is Erica coming to visit you?
00:02:19,824 --> 00:02:21,740
Because we want to get to know her better and...
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:26,626
she's never been to NY, so she wants to see all the tourist spots, you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building...
00:02:26,626 --> 00:02:30,841
Oh, those places. There's always so many people there
being crowd like cattle,
00:02:30,842 --> 00:02:34,674
and, you know, there's always some idiot who goes "Moo".
00:02:35,345 --> 00:02:39,177
Well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it?
00:02:40,423 --> 00:02:43,680
Oh hi, thanks for showing up 30 minutes late!
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:45,980
- Ross...
- No no, I'm sure you have a great excuse.
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:51,249
What, was it a hair appointment?
A mani-pedi or is there a sale at Barney's?
00:02:51,346 --> 00:02:56,136
My father had a heart attack... while I was at Barney's.
00:02:58,915 --> 00:03:01,597
- Oh my god.
- Honey. I'm so sorry.
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:02,843
Is he ok?
00:03:02,843 --> 00:03:05,717
Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine.
But he's still having sedated.
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:09,263
Ok, I'm gonna come out to Long Island with you,
I mean, you can't be alone right now.
00:03:09,263 --> 00:03:12,328
No, come on, I'm totally ok.
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:14,724
I don't need you to come.
00:03:14,724 --> 00:03:16,640
I can totally handle this on my own.
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,280
Still, still, let me come... for me.
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,825
Ok, if you really need to.
00:03:23,826 --> 00:03:26,891
I bet someone could use one of
Monica's freshly baked cookies.
00:03:26,892 --> 00:03:29,095
Oh, I really could.
00:03:36,186 --> 00:03:37,910
Alright, this seems pretty simple.
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:42,125
Your first line is "My name is Claude."
So, just repeat after me.
00:03:49,983 --> 00:03:52,761
Well, so let's try it again.
00:03:58,893 --> 00:04:03,108
Huh, it's not... quite what I'm saying.
00:04:03,588 --> 00:04:07,037
Really? It sounds exactly the same to me.
00:04:07,037 --> 00:04:09,336
It does? Really?
00:04:09,337 --> 00:04:10,869
Alright, let's just try it again.
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,169
- Really listen.
- Got it.
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:26,870
Hey, you guys!
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,648
I want you to meet someone really special.
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:33,194
Phoebe, this is Erica, and this is the baby.
00:04:33,194 --> 00:04:35,780
Joey, Erica, Baby.
00:04:35,781 --> 00:04:38,751
Everyone! Erica, Baby.
00:04:38,751 --> 00:04:41,816
Monica, calm, self.
00:04:41,817 --> 00:04:43,445
- Please, sit down.
- Thank you.
00:04:43,446 --> 00:04:46,128
It's really nice to meet you guys.
I can't believe I'm here.
00:04:46,128 --> 00:04:50,918
Well, welcome to NYC, or should I say ...
00:04:52,644 --> 00:04:54,656
Why would you say that?
00:04:55,614 --> 00:04:57,626
Ok, what are you gonna be doing today?
00:04:57,626 --> 00:05:02,320
Oh, I want to see everything.
Time Square, Coney Island, Rockefeller Center...
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:05,674
Oh, you know what you should do, you should walk
all the way to the top of Statue of Liberty.
00:05:05,674 --> 00:05:08,644
- Oh yeah, let's do that!
- Great.
00:05:08,644 --> 00:05:11,901
This baby better be really good.
00:05:16,213 --> 00:05:19,470
Hi, excuse me. I'm here to see my father.
My name is Rachel Green.
00:05:19,471 --> 00:05:20,620
And I'm Dr Ross Galler.
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:25,124
Ross, please. This is a hospital, ok?
That actually means sth here.
00:05:25,411 --> 00:05:27,231
- So, can we plase go in?
- Absolutely.
00:05:27,232 --> 00:05:30,106
Rach, I think I'm gonna wait out here because...
00:05:30,106 --> 00:05:33,076
my throat is feeling a little scratchy,
I don't wanna infect him.
00:05:33,076 --> 00:05:35,088
Ross, please, don't be so scared of him.
00:05:35,088 --> 00:05:37,770
I am not scared of him, I'm really sick.
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:39,591
He's still under sedation, so he's pretty much out.
00:05:39,591 --> 00:05:41,794
I'm feeling better.
00:05:44,574 --> 00:05:46,969
Oh, my god.
00:05:46,969 --> 00:05:53,675
Oh, wow, that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him
was just money down the drain, huh?
00:05:53,867 --> 00:05:57,412
Miss Green, your father's doctor is on the phone
if you'd like to speak to him.
00:05:57,412 --> 00:05:59,232
Oh, great. Uh, are you gonna be ok?
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:02,394
He's unconscious, I think we'll be just fine.
00:06:37,653 --> 00:06:39,952
Did the TV wake you?
00:06:39,953 --> 00:06:47,522
No, when you put your feet up on my bed,
you tucked on my cathode.
00:06:48,863 --> 00:06:51,833
Ouchy.
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:53,654
What are you doing here, Galler?
00:06:53,654 --> 00:06:57,486
Well, I came with Rachel
who should be back any second.
00:06:57,487 --> 00:06:59,019
So what's new?
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,894
Ooh, I had a little heart attack.
00:07:01,894 --> 00:07:03,522
Great, is it painful?
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:07,355
What? A heart attack is sitting here talking to you.
00:07:08,217 --> 00:07:10,803
Let's see if we can get Rachel back in here.
00:07:10,804 --> 00:07:14,540
So what's new with you, huh?
Knocked up any more of my daughters laterly?
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:17,032
Nope! Just the one. Rach!
00:07:22,972 --> 00:07:25,079
Noo!
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,241
Ok, maybe if we just break it down.
00:07:28,242 --> 00:07:32,745
Ok, let's just try one syllable at a time.
Ok, so repeat after me.
00:07:36,674 --> 00:07:38,111
Great, ok, faster.
00:07:45,776 --> 00:07:47,788
Ok, it's too hard, I can't teach you!
00:07:47,788 --> 00:07:48,458
What are you doing?
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,661
I have to go before pull your head through a wall!
00:07:50,662 --> 00:07:55,260
No, no! Don't go, I need you. My audition is tomorrow!
00:08:10,878 --> 00:08:17,584
Hey. I was gonna make some dinner but all I found
in your dad's frige was bacon and heavy cream.
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:20,747
I think we solve the mystery of heart attack.
00:08:20,747 --> 00:08:21,896
Did you call your parents?
00:08:21,897 --> 00:08:25,729
- Oh, yeah, Emma is doing great.
- Oh, good.
00:08:25,825 --> 00:08:27,645
Wow.
00:08:27,645 --> 00:08:28,794
What?
00:08:28,795 --> 00:08:32,435
Just can't believe I'm in Rachel Green's room.
00:08:32,436 --> 00:08:34,927
What do you mean? You have been in my room before.
00:08:34,927 --> 00:08:37,801
Yeah, sure, right.
00:08:37,802 --> 00:08:39,814
Like I have ever been in Rachel Green's room.
00:08:39,814 --> 00:08:43,550
Ok, I gotta tell you, it's really weird
when you use my whole name.
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:46,615
Sorry.
00:08:46,616 --> 00:08:48,723
- Are you ok?
- Yeah.
00:08:48,724 --> 00:08:50,161
'Yeah' to a rough day, huh?
00:08:50,161 --> 00:08:53,418
Yeah, it's just so weird seeing him like that, you know?
00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:57,922
I mean, he's a doctor,
you don't expect doctors to get sick.
00:08:57,922 --> 00:09:00,029
But we do.
00:09:03,671 --> 00:09:06,353
You know, he's gonna be ok, Rach.
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:12,773
Oh, I don't want him to wake up alone,
I should go to the hospital.
00:09:12,773 --> 00:09:14,976
What? No, no, wait. Hey hey, look.
00:09:14,977 --> 00:09:18,713
They gave him a lot medication, ok,
he wouldn't even know if you were there.
00:09:18,713 --> 00:09:21,204
Look, we'll go and see him
the first thing in the morning, ok?
00:09:21,204 --> 00:09:23,311
- Really? I shouldn't feel guilty?
- No, God. Hey.
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,707
Rach, you've been an amazing doughter, ok?
00:09:25,707 --> 00:09:27,623
Right now, you just need to get some rest.
00:09:27,624 --> 00:09:30,115
Ok, maybe you're right.
00:09:30,115 --> 00:09:33,276
Good night.
00:09:33,277 --> 00:09:35,863
Wait, wait.
00:09:35,864 --> 00:09:39,696
Would you stay here with me for a while?
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:41,516
Sure.
00:09:42,954 --> 00:09:45,061
Thank you for coming with me today.
00:09:45,061 --> 00:09:46,785
Oh, of course.
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:50,618
Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room.
00:09:51,002 --> 00:09:54,738
Me, too. Come here.
00:09:54,738 --> 00:09:58,091
I just don't want to be alone tonight.
00:09:58,092 --> 00:10:02,882
Ok, well, I can, maybe grab a sleeping bag or...
00:10:17,254 --> 00:10:18,978
No, Rach!
00:10:19,937 --> 00:10:23,386
I'm sorry, I just don't think this is a good idea.
00:10:23,386 --> 00:10:25,589
We won't know that until we do it, will we?
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,560
No, uh look, uhm...
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,775
You are upset about your father
and you're feeling vulnerable.
00:10:32,776 --> 00:10:37,758
And I just don't feel it will be right
if I'd like be, you know, taking advantage of you.
00:10:37,758 --> 00:10:42,548
What taking advantage?
I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!
00:10:43,219 --> 00:10:45,901
Ok, I'm sure it would be great but...
00:10:45,902 --> 00:10:51,171
I think one of us has to be thinking clearly,
so I'm gonna go.
00:11:01,136 --> 00:11:03,722
I'll see you in the morning.
00:11:05,927 --> 00:11:10,717
Haven't had sex in 4 months,
I should get a medal for that!
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,758
Thanks so much for taking me to all these places,
I had a great time.
00:11:18,758 --> 00:11:21,434
Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize
about Chandler, though.
00:11:21,434 --> 00:11:23,250
I just did not see this coming.
00:11:23,251 --> 00:11:26,787
NY is awesome!
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,368
What is with you?
00:11:29,368 --> 00:11:32,617
You know, I've been to these before
but I've never really seen them, you know?
00:11:32,618 --> 00:11:35,485
Yeah, you missed a lot when you were mooing.
00:11:36,441 --> 00:11:38,448
Thanks so much for showing me around.
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:42,175
Oh, it was our pleasure.
We're so much enjoying getting to know you.
00:11:42,176 --> 00:11:45,330
Well, is there anything else you want to know?
00:11:45,713 --> 00:11:49,536
Oh, uh, ok.
00:11:49,823 --> 00:11:52,212
Do you mind if I ask you some questions
about the father?
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,314
Oh, sure, yeah.
00:11:54,315 --> 00:11:59,380
Well, he was my high school boyfriend,
captain of the football team, really cute.
00:11:59,381 --> 00:12:01,674
And he got a scholarship, went off to college.
00:12:01,675 --> 00:12:03,491
That's great.
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:07,505
Yeah, it's almost definitely him.
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,372
How is that now?
00:12:10,373 --> 00:12:13,240
Well, there is a chance it's another guy.
00:12:13,241 --> 00:12:19,167
I mean, I've only ever been with 2 guys
but they sorta overlapped.
00:12:19,836 --> 00:12:22,607
So, what does the other guy do?
Does he go to the college, too?
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:25,188
No, he's in prison.
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,923
Uh, was he falsely accused of sth?
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:34,842
No. He killed his father with a shovel.
00:12:36,563 --> 00:12:38,856
But other than that he's a great guy.
00:12:38,857 --> 00:12:42,680
I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
00:12:51,665 --> 00:12:53,767
- Are you awake?
- Of course I'm awake.
00:12:53,768 --> 00:12:57,591
As so from now on I'm always awake.
00:12:58,452 --> 00:13:01,892
Alright, we don't know that it's him.
I mean, it could be the football guy.
00:13:01,893 --> 00:13:05,716
Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel killer.
00:13:09,252 --> 00:13:11,163
Alright, alright, let's say it is him.
00:13:11,164 --> 00:13:14,318
Would we not want baby? No.
Would we treat him any differently?
00:13:14,318 --> 00:13:17,472
I'll keep an eye on him.
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,678
- We have to find out which one the father is.
- How?
00:13:21,678 --> 00:13:24,641
I don't know, there're tests for these things, right?
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:26,934
Yeah, but maybe we're just overreacting.
00:13:26,935 --> 00:13:30,758
Easy for you to say. He's a father killer.
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:32,479
He probably loves his mommy.
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:36,302
He's probably got a tattoo says "Mom"
on the shovel wielding arm.
00:13:41,082 --> 00:13:44,905
"We'll now count from 1 to 5: ....."
00:13:54,081 --> 00:13:57,904
- "Good job!"
- Thank you.
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,720
Hey, Joey.
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:05,359
Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday
and I thought it about a lot know I was too inpatient.
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,698
So let's try it again.
00:14:06,698 --> 00:14:11,955
Oh no, that's ok. I don't need your help.
I work it out on myself and I gotta say I'm pretty good.
00:14:12,433 --> 00:14:13,866
Really? Can I hear some of them?
00:14:13,867 --> 00:14:16,925
Sure, sure.
00:14:16,925 --> 00:14:18,836
Ok.
00:14:25,624 --> 00:14:27,344
See?
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,932
Alright, you're not, you're not...
00:14:31,932 --> 00:14:35,755
Again, you're not SPEAKING FRENCH!
00:14:36,998 --> 00:14:40,343
Oh, well I think I am, yeah.
And I think I'm definitely gonna get the part.
00:14:40,343 --> 00:14:42,350
How could you possibly think that?
00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:46,174
For one thing, the guy on the tape said
I was doing a good job!
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:52,196
Hi, Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?
00:14:54,012 --> 00:14:55,063
Sure.
00:14:56,975 --> 00:15:00,320
You've been quiet all morning, is everything ok?
00:15:02,614 --> 00:15:05,768
- You sure you are alright.
- Yep.
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:09,592
Ookay. Uhm, well I'm gonna go grab some breakfast.
00:15:09,592 --> 00:15:12,937
- FYI...
- There it is.
00:15:13,606 --> 00:15:20,679
In the future, when a girl asks for
some ill-advised sympathy sex, just do it.
00:15:21,062 --> 00:15:25,172
Wait, wait, you're mad at me about last night?
00:15:25,363 --> 00:15:27,083
I was just trying to do the right thing.
00:15:27,084 --> 00:15:32,436
Really? Well it seems to me if you've done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed,
00:15:32,436 --> 00:15:36,259
I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied.
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,465
- Well...
- Oh, stop that!
00:15:41,134 --> 00:15:42,663
I can't believe this. What do you...
00:15:42,664 --> 00:15:44,002
I was just being a good guy.
00:15:44,002 --> 00:15:46,487
I treated you with respect and understanding.
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:49,258
Ahh, that is so hot.
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:51,075
Hey, I was looking out for you.
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:56,809
Oh, really? Well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl,
I don't need someone telling me what is best for me.
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:01,971
I gotta say I have not had sex a lot times before,
this is the worst ever.
00:16:02,067 --> 00:16:05,507
Oh really, really?
Well, it wasn't very good for me, either.
00:16:05,508 --> 00:16:07,610
Oh, ok, you know, hey hey! You know what?
00:16:07,611 --> 00:16:12,103
To avoid this little thing in the future,
let's just say you and me, never having sex again.
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:12,772
What?
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:18,793
That's right, sex is off the table!
I'm never having sex with you again.
00:16:24,338 --> 00:16:27,205
Dr Green, are you feeling better?
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,939
Hey, how was lunch?
00:16:30,939 --> 00:16:32,666
We had a good time.
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:35,162
BTW, I want to ask you sth.
00:16:35,163 --> 00:16:36,986
It would really mean a lot to me.
00:16:36,986 --> 00:16:43,705
If the baby is a boy, would you
name him after my father Jiminy Billy Bob?
00:16:47,353 --> 00:16:48,696
Oh, really?
00:16:48,697 --> 00:16:52,536
Noo. You were right, that was fun.
00:16:54,744 --> 00:16:58,583
I'm gonna go finish packing.
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,230
So, is she gonna take the test?
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:04,822
No, she doesn't have to.
I found out who the father is.
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:08,182
Oh, God, it's Shovelly Joe, isn't it?
00:17:08,182 --> 00:17:08,853
No, it's not.
00:17:08,854 --> 00:17:10,005
How do you know?
00:17:10,006 --> 00:17:13,077
Well, it turns out that
Erica didn't pay much attention in sex ed class.
00:17:13,077 --> 00:17:17,300
Because the thing she did with the prison guy
would be pretty hard to make a baby that way.
00:17:17,301 --> 00:17:22,100
Oh, God. What was it? The thing
we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?
00:17:23,828 --> 00:17:26,611
The thing we never do.
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:29,491
Shovelly Joe.
00:17:37,842 --> 00:17:41,201
- Whenever you're ready, Joey.
- Right.
00:17:48,496 --> 00:17:49,743
I'm sorry, what's going on?
00:17:49,744 --> 00:17:52,623
Dude, come on. French it up.
00:17:54,256 --> 00:17:56,175
Joey, do you speak French?
00:18:03,086 --> 00:18:06,157
You know what, I think this audition is over.
00:18:06,158 --> 00:18:08,653
Uh, excuse me?
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:12,493
Uh, I am Ugeon Phillogne.
00:18:13,069 --> 00:18:22,859
I was passing by when I heard this man speaking
the regional dialect of my French town of Estelloude.
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,795
You really think this man is speaking French.
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:57,798
Good job, little buddy.
00:19:00,198 --> 00:19:02,213
That was some really good French.
00:19:02,214 --> 00:19:04,901
But I think we're gonna go with someone else for the part.
00:19:04,902 --> 00:19:07,685
Oh, alright. But my French was good?
00:19:07,685 --> 00:19:10,084
It was great.
00:19:10,085 --> 00:19:11,716
Merci.
00:19:19,684 --> 00:19:22,659
- Emmas's down for the night.
- Oh, good.
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:26,498
So, I guess I'm gonna takeoff.
00:19:26,595 --> 00:19:28,994
Hey, listen, just before you go, I...
00:19:28,994 --> 00:19:31,393
Again I just wanna say 'thank you' for coming with me.
00:19:31,394 --> 00:19:33,313
Oh, no problem.
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:38,113
And also, you know I...
I was thinking about what you said,
00:19:38,113 --> 00:19:40,800
uh, you know, about the whole sex thing and...
00:19:40,801 --> 00:19:44,352
Probably not a great idea to go down that road again.
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,519
Thank you. I'm glad you agree.
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,127
It's shame though, I mean, when we did it,
it was pretty good.
00:19:52,415 --> 00:19:56,254
Yeah, yeah, that's true.
00:19:56,351 --> 00:19:59,422
Hey, do you remember that one really great time?
00:19:59,422 --> 00:20:00,669
Oh, yeah.
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:04,509
- You know, it was your birthday...
- It was Valentine's day...
00:20:05,085 --> 00:20:08,924
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
00:20:10,845 --> 00:20:14,684
Well, I guess that's all the past now.
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:19,579
Uh-huh.
00:20:19,579 --> 00:20:23,034
- Not even one more time.
- Not even once.
00:20:23,035 --> 00:20:27,162
- No matter how much we want it.
- Even if we want it REALLY bad.
00:20:27,162 --> 00:20:29,465
That's what WE decided.
00:20:29,466 --> 00:20:33,305
Right.
00:20:33,881 --> 00:20:35,800
- It's kinda hard, though.
- Yeah.
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:40,504
You know? When two people have a connection,
you know, that's...
00:20:40,984 --> 00:20:46,455
just seems like... such a waste.
00:20:50,007 --> 00:20:52,598
I hate waste.
00:20:56,726 --> 00:20:59,125
- Ross...
- Yes.
00:20:59,126 --> 00:21:01,909
Just so you know,
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:06,613
with us, it's never off the table.
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,124
Dammit, it's never off the table.
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,724
Ok, can you really tap dance?
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:29,685
No.
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:32,765
Off the resume.
00:21:32,765 --> 00:21:35,074
- Archery?
- No.
00:21:35,074 --> 00:21:38,922
- Horseback riding?
- Would fall off a lot.
00:21:39,596 --> 00:21:41,905
You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
00:21:41,906 --> 00:21:44,022
That I can do.
00:21:44,022 --> 00:21:47,678
Come on, you can drink a GALLON of milk
in 10 seconds?
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,527
Alright, watch me!
00:21:51,624 --> 00:21:53,355
Ok, your time, are you ready?
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:57,203
Ready, go!
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,994
You did it!
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
