00:00:02,245 --> 00:00:06,158
Everybody! Central Perk
is proud to present. . .
00:00:06,605 --> 00:00:10,154
. . .the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.
00:00:12,765 --> 00:00:13,561
Thanks.
00:00:14,805 --> 00:00:17,444
I wanna start with a song
that's about that moment. . .
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:21,121
. . .when you suddenly realize
what life is really all about.
00:00:21,885 --> 00:00:23,000
Here we go.
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:29,404
Thank you very much.
00:00:41,605 --> 00:00:43,960
Oh, great! This is just--
00:00:49,685 --> 00:00:51,676
The One With the Blackout
00:00:52,965 --> 00:00:53,954
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.
00:01:38,485 --> 00:01:40,203
This is so cool, you guys.
00:01:40,445 --> 00:01:42,401
The entire city's blacked out.
00:01:42,645 --> 00:01:45,034
Mom says it's Manhattan,
Brooklyn and Queens. . .
00:01:45,245 --> 00:01:47,475
. . .and doesn't know when
it'll be back on.
00:01:47,685 --> 00:01:49,164
You guys, this is big.
00:01:49,405 --> 00:01:51,600
Pants and a sweater.
Why, Mom?
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,517
Who will I meet in a blackout?
00:01:54,965 --> 00:01:58,196
Power-company guys?
Eligible looters?
00:01:58,605 --> 00:02:00,402
Can we talk about this later?
00:02:01,365 --> 00:02:02,434
Can I borrow the phone?
00:02:02,685 --> 00:02:05,802
I wanna call my apartment
and check on my grandma.
00:02:06,205 --> 00:02:07,479
What's my number?
00:02:09,285 --> 00:02:10,957
I never call me.
00:02:12,605 --> 00:02:14,038
Oh, my God! It's her.
00:02:14,285 --> 00:02:16,196
It's that Victoria Secret model.
00:02:16,405 --> 00:02:17,724
Something Goodacre.
00:02:17,965 --> 00:02:19,239
Hi, Mom, it's Jill.
00:02:19,485 --> 00:02:21,794
She's right. It's Jill.
Jill Goodacre.
00:02:22,485 --> 00:02:23,838
Oh, my God!
00:02:24,085 --> 00:02:27,760
I am trapped in an A TM vestibule
with Jill Goodacre.
00:02:28,885 --> 00:02:31,797
Is it a vestibule?
Maybe it's an atrium?
00:02:32,245 --> 00:02:35,794
Yeah, that is the part
to focus on, you idiot.
00:02:36,845 --> 00:02:40,554
I'm fine. I'm just stuck
at the bank in an ATM vestibule.
00:02:40,805 --> 00:02:42,636
Jill says vestibule...
00:02:42,885 --> 00:02:45,001
...I'm going with vestibule.
00:02:45,845 --> 00:02:46,880
I'm fine.
00:02:47,245 --> 00:02:48,997
No, I'm not alone.
00:02:49,485 --> 00:02:50,964
I don't know, some guy.
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:55,244
Oh, some guy. I am some guy.
00:02:55,485 --> 00:02:58,045
Hey Jill, I saw you
with some guy last night.
00:02:58,285 --> 00:03:00,924
Yes, he was some guy.
00:03:09,685 --> 00:03:11,403
Hey, everyone.
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:20,284
Officiating at tonight's blackout
is Rabbi Tribbiani.
00:03:24,365 --> 00:03:28,643
Chandler's old roommate was Jewish, and
these are the only candles we have. . .
00:03:28,885 --> 00:03:30,034
. . .so happy Hanukkah!
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:35,202
Look! Ugly Naked Guy
lit a bunch of candles.
00:03:42,405 --> 00:03:44,202
That had to hurt!
00:03:45,765 --> 00:03:48,438
All right, all right!
It's been 14 1/2 minutes...
00:03:48,685 --> 00:03:51,358
...and you still haven 't said
one word. Oh, God!
00:03:51,645 --> 00:03:55,194
Do something!
Just make contact. Smile!
00:03:58,685 --> 00:04:00,118
There you go.
00:04:03,805 --> 00:04:05,841
You're definitely scaring her.
00:04:06,685 --> 00:04:08,516
Would you like to call somebody?
00:04:09,085 --> 00:04:12,395
Yeah, about 300 guys I went
to high school with.
00:04:17,605 --> 00:04:19,197
Yeah, thanks.
00:04:23,605 --> 00:04:24,401
It's me.
00:04:24,605 --> 00:04:25,515
It's Chandler.
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:26,754
Are you okay?
00:04:27,005 --> 00:04:28,404
I'm fine.
00:04:28,765 --> 00:04:32,394
I'm stuck in an ATM vestibule. . .
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,523
. . .with Jill Goodacre.
00:04:37,365 --> 00:04:38,161
What?
00:04:38,405 --> 00:04:40,202
I'm stuck. . .
00:04:40,885 --> 00:04:43,479
. . .in an ATM vestibule. . .
00:04:43,685 --> 00:04:45,801
. . .with Jill Goodacre.
00:04:47,085 --> 00:04:48,837
I have no idea what you said.
00:04:49,085 --> 00:04:50,882
Put Joey on the phone.
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:54,961
What's up, man?
00:04:55,205 --> 00:04:56,433
I'm stuck. . .
00:04:57,085 --> 00:04:59,645
. . .in an ATM vestibule. . .
00:05:00,205 --> 00:05:02,799
. . .with Jill Goodacre!
00:05:04,045 --> 00:05:05,034
Oh, my God!
00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:08,436
He's trapped in an ATM vestibule
with Jill Goodacre!
00:05:10,485 --> 00:05:11,474
Chandler, listen.
00:05:15,365 --> 00:05:18,004
Like that thought
never entered my mind.
00:05:21,485 --> 00:05:22,759
Come on, somebody.
00:05:22,965 --> 00:05:24,239
I'll go. I'll go.
00:05:24,445 --> 00:05:28,484
Senior year of college,
on a pool table.
00:05:28,685 --> 00:05:30,118
Pool table?
00:05:30,365 --> 00:05:32,003
That's my sister.
00:05:34,085 --> 00:05:36,804
My weirdest place would have to be. . .
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:41,402
. . .the women's room on the second floor
of the New York City Public Library.
00:05:41,605 --> 00:05:44,403
Oh, my God! What were you
doing in a library?
00:05:46,445 --> 00:05:48,003
Pheebs, what about you?
00:05:48,805 --> 00:05:50,204
Milwaukee.
00:05:54,365 --> 00:05:56,083
Ross?
00:05:57,485 --> 00:06:00,955
Disneyland, 1989.
''It's a small world after all. ''
00:06:03,245 --> 00:06:04,280
No way!
00:06:04,525 --> 00:06:05,799
The ride broke down. . .
00:06:06,005 --> 00:06:09,964
. . .so Carol and I went behind a couple
of those mechanical Dutch children.
00:06:11,365 --> 00:06:15,597
They fixed the ride, and we were asked
never to return to the Magic Kingdom.
00:06:16,885 --> 00:06:17,840
Rachel?
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,194
I already went.
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,242
-You did not go.
-Yes, I did.
00:06:21,445 --> 00:06:22,958
Tell us. Come on.
00:06:24,205 --> 00:06:27,800
The weirdest place would have to be. . .
00:06:30,205 --> 00:06:32,002
. . .the foot of the bed.
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:36,119
-Step back!
-We have a winner!
00:06:42,965 --> 00:06:46,116
I've never had a relationship
with that kind of passion.
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:50,278
Where you have to have somebody right
there in the middle of a theme park.
00:06:53,285 --> 00:06:56,561
It was the only thing to do there
that didn't have a line.
00:06:58,245 --> 00:07:02,124
Barry wouldn't even kiss me
on a miniature golf course.
00:07:02,325 --> 00:07:03,155
Come on.
00:07:03,365 --> 00:07:05,959
He said we were holding up
the people behind us.
00:07:06,845 --> 00:07:08,881
And you didn't marry him because. . .?
00:07:10,685 --> 00:07:14,121
Do you think there are people
that go through life. . .
00:07:14,365 --> 00:07:16,674
. . .never having that kind of. . .?
00:07:16,925 --> 00:07:18,438
-Probably.
-Really?
00:07:18,685 --> 00:07:21,836
I'll tell you something.
Passion is way overrated.
00:07:22,085 --> 00:07:23,484
-Yeah, right.
-It is.
00:07:24,165 --> 00:07:26,315
Eventually, it kind of burns out.
00:07:26,565 --> 00:07:31,161
But hopefully what you're left
with is trust and security and. . . .
00:07:31,365 --> 00:07:33,276
In my ex-wife's case,
lesbianism.
00:07:38,885 --> 00:07:42,434
For all those people who miss out
on that passion thing. . .
00:07:42,685 --> 00:07:44,198
. . .there's other good stuff.
00:07:47,445 --> 00:07:49,322
But I don't think that'll be you.
00:07:50,245 --> 00:07:51,360
You don't?
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,915
I see big passion in your future.
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:56,921
Really?
00:07:57,845 --> 00:07:59,119
-You do?
-I do.
00:07:59,845 --> 00:08:01,198
Ross, you're so great.
00:08:11,885 --> 00:08:14,001
It's never gonna happen.
00:08:20,605 --> 00:08:21,515
What?
00:08:21,765 --> 00:08:22,595
You and Rachel.
00:08:31,565 --> 00:08:32,600
Why not?
00:08:34,645 --> 00:08:36,954
Because you waited too long
to make your move. . .
00:08:37,165 --> 00:08:39,998
. . .and now you're in the ''Friend Zone. ''
00:08:41,885 --> 00:08:42,954
I'm not in the Zone.
00:08:43,205 --> 00:08:45,161
No, Ross.
You're mayor of the Zone.
00:08:47,045 --> 00:08:49,400
Look, I'm taking my time, all right?
00:08:49,605 --> 00:08:51,402
I'm laying the groundwork.
00:08:51,605 --> 00:08:54,073
Every day I get
a little bit closer to. . . .
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,394
Priesthood!
00:08:57,605 --> 00:09:00,802
I'm telling you, she has
no idea what you're thinking.
00:09:01,005 --> 00:09:05,078
If you don't ask her out soon,
you'll end up stuck in the Zone forever.
00:09:05,325 --> 00:09:06,724
I will, I will.
00:09:06,965 --> 00:09:09,195
I'm waiting for the right moment.
00:09:11,805 --> 00:09:12,999
What?
00:09:13,685 --> 00:09:14,481
What, now?
00:09:17,445 --> 00:09:18,719
What's messing you up?
The wine?
00:09:18,965 --> 00:09:21,604
The candles? The moonlight?
00:09:21,805 --> 00:09:25,195
You gotta go up to her and say,
''Look, Rachel, I think--''
00:09:27,165 --> 00:09:28,917
-What are we shushing?
-We're shushing. . .
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,477
. . .because we're trying to
hear something.
00:09:32,725 --> 00:09:33,999
What?
00:09:34,485 --> 00:09:35,998
Don't you hear that?
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,399
See?
00:09:47,085 --> 00:09:48,438
Would you like some gum?
00:09:48,685 --> 00:09:49,561
Is it sugarless?
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:54,041
-Sorry, it's not.
-Then, no thanks.
00:09:54,285 --> 00:09:55,604
What the hell was that?
00:09:58,005 --> 00:10:01,839
Mental note: If Jill Goodacre
offers you gum, you take it.
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:05,998
If she offers you mangled
animal carcass, you take it!
00:10:08,245 --> 00:10:11,317
New York City has no power
00:10:11,565 --> 00:10:15,001
And the milk is getting sour
00:10:15,245 --> 00:10:18,442
But to me it is not scary
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:22,598
'Cause I stay away from dairy
00:10:31,485 --> 00:10:32,804
-Here goes.
-You'll do it?
00:10:33,005 --> 00:10:34,404
-I'll do it.
-Want help?
00:10:34,645 --> 00:10:36,795
You come out there,
you're a dead man.
00:10:39,365 --> 00:10:40,320
Good luck, man.
00:10:41,205 --> 00:10:42,399
Thanks.
00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:52,843
-Where you going?
-Outside.
00:10:53,045 --> 00:10:54,000
You can't!
00:10:54,645 --> 00:10:55,441
Why not?
00:10:55,685 --> 00:10:57,721
Because of the reason.
00:10:59,885 --> 00:11:00,681
That would be. . .?
00:11:02,285 --> 00:11:03,081
I can't tell you.
00:11:03,325 --> 00:11:04,360
What's going on?
00:11:05,885 --> 00:11:09,878
Listen. You gotta promise you'll
never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
00:11:10,085 --> 00:11:12,838
-About what?
-He's planning your birthday party.
00:11:14,485 --> 00:11:16,237
Oh, my God! I love him!
00:11:16,485 --> 00:11:17,884
You better act surprised.
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:18,921
About what?
00:11:19,165 --> 00:11:20,314
My surprise party.
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:24,404
-What surprise party?
-Oh, stop it. Joey already told me.
00:11:25,005 --> 00:11:26,438
Well, he didn't tell me.
00:11:27,085 --> 00:11:29,838
Don't look at me.
This is Ross' thing.
00:11:30,085 --> 00:11:33,236
This is so typical. I'm always
the last to know everything.
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:35,316
You are not. We tell you stuff.
00:11:36,205 --> 00:11:40,642
I was the last one to know when Chandler
got bit by the peacock at the zoo.
00:11:41,365 --> 00:11:45,199
I was the last to know you had a crush
on Joey when he was moving in.
00:11:47,245 --> 00:11:49,076
Looks like I was second to last.
00:11:54,485 --> 00:11:56,203
It's so nice.
00:12:00,645 --> 00:12:02,397
I have a question.
00:12:04,005 --> 00:12:06,439
Actually, it's not
so much a question. . .
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:09,199
. . .it's more of a general wondering. . . .
00:12:10,165 --> 00:12:11,393
--ment.
00:12:14,485 --> 00:12:15,998
Here goes.
00:12:18,565 --> 00:12:22,194
Well, for a while now,
I've been wanting to. . . .
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:24,923
Yes, that's right.
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,355
Look at that little kitty!
00:12:30,845 --> 00:12:35,236
I'm on the top of the world
Looking down on creation
00:12:35,485 --> 00:12:40,400
And the only explanation I can find
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:45,561
Is the love that I found
Ever since you've been around
00:12:47,285 --> 00:12:50,004
All right, this is just Bactine.
It won't hurt.
00:12:53,165 --> 00:12:55,395
Sorry, that was wax.
00:12:57,525 --> 00:13:00,642
Poor little Tootie's scared.
We should find his owner.
00:13:00,885 --> 00:13:03,115
Why not put ''poor little Tootie''
in the hall?
00:13:04,245 --> 00:13:06,884
During a blackout?
She'll get trampled.
00:13:11,085 --> 00:13:13,599
On second thought,
gum would be perfection.
00:13:15,005 --> 00:13:16,563
Gum would be perfection?
00:13:17,725 --> 00:13:19,795
Gum would be perfection.
00:13:20,005 --> 00:13:23,441
Could've said, ''Gum would be nice. ''
''I'll have a stick. '' But, no.
00:13:23,685 --> 00:13:26,757
For me, gum is perfection.
00:13:27,805 --> 00:13:30,558
I loathe myself!
00:13:33,005 --> 00:13:36,395
Oh, no, the Mellons.
They hate all living things, right?
00:13:42,885 --> 00:13:44,284
We just found this cat. . .
00:13:44,525 --> 00:13:45,958
. . .and we're looking for the owner.
00:13:47,685 --> 00:13:48,481
It's mine.
00:13:49,885 --> 00:13:52,319
He seems to hate you.
Are you sure?
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,237
It's my cat. Give me my cat.
00:13:55,165 --> 00:13:56,803
Wait a minute. What's his name?
00:13:57,765 --> 00:13:58,754
Bob-- Buttons.
00:14:00,085 --> 00:14:00,995
Bob Buttons?
00:14:01,685 --> 00:14:03,562
Bob Buttons.
Here, Bob Buttons.
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:08,005
You are a very bad man!
00:14:09,365 --> 00:14:11,003
You owe me a cat.
00:14:15,285 --> 00:14:17,003
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
00:14:19,245 --> 00:14:21,805
Where did you go,
little kitty, kitty?
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:40,197
Come on, lucky sixes!
00:14:41,085 --> 00:14:43,724
Everybody, this is Paolo.
00:14:44,245 --> 00:14:46,201
Paolo, I want you to meet my friends.
00:14:46,445 --> 00:14:48,242
This is Monica. . .
00:14:49,285 --> 00:14:50,798
. . .and Joey. . .
00:14:52,165 --> 00:14:53,803
. . .and Ross.
00:15:01,005 --> 00:15:03,200
He doesn't speak much English.
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:06,202
Monopoly!
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:09,323
Look at that!
00:15:12,405 --> 00:15:13,838
Where did Paolo come from?
00:15:14,685 --> 00:15:16,277
Italy, I think.
00:15:16,565 --> 00:15:20,274
No, I mean tonight, in the building?
Suddenly into our lives?
00:15:21,565 --> 00:15:25,524
The cat turned out to be
Paolo's cat. Isn't that funny?
00:15:27,285 --> 00:15:30,402
That is funny. And Rachel
keeps touching him.
00:15:33,045 --> 00:15:37,004
I looked all over the building
and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
00:15:37,245 --> 00:15:39,554
I found him.
It was Paolo's cat.
00:15:40,285 --> 00:15:43,004
Well, there you go.
Last to know again.
00:15:44,045 --> 00:15:47,196
And I'm guessing, since nobody
told me, this is Paolo?
00:15:47,965 --> 00:15:50,081
Paolo, this is Phoebe.
00:15:55,445 --> 00:15:56,639
You betcha!
00:16:00,245 --> 00:16:03,157
All right. Okay. What next?
00:16:03,605 --> 00:16:06,438
Blow a bubble. A bubble's good.
00:16:06,645 --> 00:16:09,239
It's got a boyish charm.
It's impish.
00:16:09,445 --> 00:16:10,798
Here we go.
00:16:21,885 --> 00:16:23,398
Nice going, imp!
00:16:24,165 --> 00:16:26,520
It's okay. All I need to do is...
00:16:26,725 --> 00:16:29,683
...reach over and put it
back in my mouth.
00:16:32,765 --> 00:16:36,235
Good save!
We're back on track and I'm...
00:16:36,845 --> 00:16:39,484
...chewing someone else's gum.
00:16:40,845 --> 00:16:42,244
This is not my gum!
00:16:42,445 --> 00:16:44,242
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
00:16:45,165 --> 00:16:46,996
And now you're choking.
00:16:49,085 --> 00:16:49,915
You all right?
00:16:52,085 --> 00:16:53,803
Oh, my God!
You're choking!
00:16:58,765 --> 00:16:59,993
Better?
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,397
Thank you. That was. . . .
00:17:04,005 --> 00:17:04,835
That was. . . .
00:17:05,605 --> 00:17:06,435
Perfection?
00:17:28,285 --> 00:17:30,003
What'd he say that was so funny?
00:17:30,245 --> 00:17:32,805
I have absolutely no idea.
00:17:33,245 --> 00:17:35,122
That's classic.
00:17:35,365 --> 00:17:37,242
My God, you guys!
What am I doing?
00:17:37,485 --> 00:17:39,237
This is so un-me!
00:17:39,485 --> 00:17:40,918
If you want, I'll do it.
00:17:43,205 --> 00:17:45,719
I just wanna bite his bottom lip.
00:17:46,685 --> 00:17:48,004
But I won't.
00:17:49,205 --> 00:17:51,196
The first time he smiled at me. . .
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:55,358
. . .those seconds were more exciting
than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.
00:17:55,605 --> 00:17:56,924
Did you rent mopeds?
00:17:59,005 --> 00:18:00,404
Because I've heard--
00:18:01,005 --> 00:18:03,155
Oh, it's not about that right now.
00:18:03,885 --> 00:18:07,195
I know it's totally superficial,
and we have nothing in common. . .
00:18:07,445 --> 00:18:09,834
. . . .and we don't even speak
the same language. . .
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:11,478
. . .but God!
00:18:18,685 --> 00:18:20,004
Listen. . . .
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:27,001
Listen, something you should know.
00:18:27,845 --> 00:18:30,234
Rachel and I are. . . .
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,794
We're kind of a thing.
00:18:33,285 --> 00:18:35,845
-Thing?
-Thing. Yes, thing.
00:18:36,205 --> 00:18:38,241
You have the sex?
00:18:41,045 --> 00:18:45,197
Technically, the sex is not being had.
But that's. . . .
00:18:45,885 --> 00:18:47,284
That's not the point.
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:52,277
The point is that
Rachel and I should be. . . .
00:18:53,045 --> 00:18:55,605
Well, Rachel and I
should be together.
00:18:55,805 --> 00:18:57,602
And if you get in the. . . .
00:18:58,205 --> 00:18:59,399
In bed?
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,357
No, not where I was going.
00:19:03,565 --> 00:19:08,320
If you get in the way of us
becoming a thing. . .
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:11,284
. . .then I would be, well, very sad.
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:14,354
So do you. . .?
00:19:20,645 --> 00:19:22,283
You do know a little English?
00:19:22,525 --> 00:19:23,401
Little.
00:19:24,005 --> 00:19:26,121
Do you know the word crap-weasel?
00:19:28,485 --> 00:19:30,999
That's funny,
you are a huge crap-weasel.
00:19:36,085 --> 00:19:39,555
Chandler, we've been here for an hour
doing this. Watch, it's easy.
00:19:39,765 --> 00:19:40,993
Ready?
00:19:45,085 --> 00:19:46,404
Now try it.
00:19:48,005 --> 00:19:49,597
You gotta whip it.
00:19:54,845 --> 00:19:57,996
Look, look! The last candle's
about to burn out.
00:19:58,245 --> 00:20:02,238
00:20:02,485 --> 00:20:06,683
. . .minus 46, minus 47,
minus 48. . . .
00:20:07,805 --> 00:20:09,796
-Thank you.
-Thanks.
00:20:10,965 --> 00:20:13,843
Kind of spooky without any lights.
00:20:21,045 --> 00:20:23,605
Okay, guys, I have the definitive one.
00:20:36,965 --> 00:20:39,320
This isn't the best time
to bring it up. . .
00:20:39,565 --> 00:20:41,999
. . .but you have to throw
a party for Monica.
00:20:50,765 --> 00:20:52,562
This has been fun.
00:20:52,805 --> 00:20:56,036
Yes. Thanks for letting me
use your phone. . .
00:20:56,445 --> 00:20:58,242
. . .and for saving my life.
00:20:59,685 --> 00:21:01,118
Well, goodbye, Chandler.
00:21:01,365 --> 00:21:03,276
I had a great blackout.
00:21:04,205 --> 00:21:05,399
See you.
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:26,001
I'm account number 7143457. And I don't
know if you got any of that. . .
00:21:26,205 --> 00:21:29,595
. . .but I would really
like a copy of the tape.
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
