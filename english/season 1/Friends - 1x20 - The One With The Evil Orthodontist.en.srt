00:00:03,416 --> 00:00:06,169
I can't believe
you would actually say that.
00:00:06,416 --> 00:00:09,533
I would much rather be Mr. Peanut
than Mr. Salty.
00:00:09,896 --> 00:00:12,364
No way!
Mr. Salty is a sailor.
00:00:12,616 --> 00:00:15,289
He's gotta be, like,
the toughest snack there is.
00:00:16,776 --> 00:00:20,132
I don't know. You don't
wanna mess with corn nuts.
00:00:20,616 --> 00:00:22,129
They're crazy!
00:00:24,216 --> 00:00:26,525
Oh, my God! You gotta come see this.
00:00:26,736 --> 00:00:29,534
There's some creep out there
with a telescope!
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:33,930
I can't believe it!
He's looking right at us!
00:00:34,136 --> 00:00:35,967
Oh, that is so sick!
00:00:36,216 --> 00:00:37,774
I feel violated.
00:00:38,016 --> 00:00:39,688
And not in a good way.
00:00:39,896 --> 00:00:41,409
How can people do that?
00:00:44,056 --> 00:00:46,616
You guys, look!
Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,293
The One With the Evil Orthodontist
00:00:52,536 --> 00:00:53,525

GELULA & CO., INC.
00:01:38,176 --> 00:01:41,373
I tell you, years from now,
school children will study it. . .
00:01:41,616 --> 00:01:44,528
. . .as one of the greatest
first dates of all time.
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,331
It was unbelievable.
00:01:46,576 --> 00:01:49,534
We could be ourselves.
We didn't have to play games.
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:50,572
Have you called her?
00:01:50,776 --> 00:01:53,131
Let her know I like her?
Are you insane?
00:01:53,776 --> 00:01:55,004
Guys! It's gross!
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:57,650
It's the next day.
How needy do I wanna seem?
00:01:57,896 --> 00:01:59,170
I'm right. Right?
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:00,929
Yeah, let her dangle.
00:02:02,696 --> 00:02:05,130
I can't believe my parents
are pressuring me. . .
00:02:05,336 --> 00:02:06,849
. . .to find one of you people.
00:02:07,096 --> 00:02:09,530
God!
Come on. Just do it.
00:02:09,776 --> 00:02:13,007
Call her.
Stop being so testosterone-y.
00:02:14,576 --> 00:02:17,136
Which, by the way,
is the real San Francisco treat.
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:24,327
-I got her machine.
-Her answering machine?
00:02:24,616 --> 00:02:26,811
No, interestingly,
her leaf blower picked up.
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:32,366
So why didn't you say anything?
00:02:32,616 --> 00:02:35,176
No. Last time I left
a spontaneous message. . .
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:38,135
. . .I ended up using the phrase,
''Yes, indeed-io! ''
00:02:40,336 --> 00:02:43,328
Look, it's Rachel and Barry.
Don't everybody look at once.
00:02:43,976 --> 00:02:45,455
Okay! What's going on?
00:02:45,656 --> 00:02:46,884
They're just talking.
00:02:47,096 --> 00:02:48,575
Does he look upset?
00:02:48,816 --> 00:02:51,250
Does he look like he was told
to shove anything?
00:02:53,776 --> 00:02:55,573
No. Actually, he's smiling.
00:02:55,816 --> 00:02:57,852
Oh, my God! Don't do that!
00:02:58,056 --> 00:02:58,966
What? What? What?
00:02:59,176 --> 00:03:02,134
That man across the street
just kicked that pigeon.
00:03:04,816 --> 00:03:09,731
And basically, that's how
a bill becomes a law.
00:03:11,296 --> 00:03:12,172
See?
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:13,531
Hey, Rach.
00:03:14,776 --> 00:03:15,925
How'd it go?
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:19,931
You know, it was actually
really great.
00:03:20,376 --> 00:03:22,173
Took me to lunch
at the Russian Tea Room.
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:25,089
I had that chicken, where you poke it
and butter squirts out.
00:03:25,736 --> 00:03:27,692
Not a good day for birds.
00:03:27,896 --> 00:03:29,568
Then we took a walk to Bendel's.
00:03:29,816 --> 00:03:33,331
And I told him not to, but he got me
a little bottle of Chanel.
00:03:34,136 --> 00:03:35,046
That's nice.
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,730
Now was that before or after
you told him. . .
00:03:37,936 --> 00:03:41,246
. . .to stop calling, stop sending
flowers and to leave you alone?
00:03:42,616 --> 00:03:43,412
Right.
00:03:43,616 --> 00:03:46,289
Well, we never actually got to that.
00:03:46,536 --> 00:03:49,369
It was just so nice to see him again,
you know?
00:03:49,576 --> 00:03:52,932
It was comfortable
and it was familiar.
00:03:53,376 --> 00:03:54,775
It was just nice.
00:03:55,016 --> 00:03:56,734
That's nice twice.
00:03:58,216 --> 00:03:59,251
What's going on?
00:03:59,496 --> 00:04:01,930
Isn't this the same Barry who
you left at the altar?
00:04:02,296 --> 00:04:03,695
Where have you been?
00:04:05,616 --> 00:04:07,447
But it was different
with him today.
00:04:07,696 --> 00:04:10,335
He wasn't, like,
Orthodontist Guy, you know?
00:04:10,576 --> 00:04:14,171
I mean, we had fun!
Is there anything wrong with that?
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:18,012
Why?
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,934
I have my reasons.
00:04:22,336 --> 00:04:25,169
How about the fact that he's
engaged to another woman. . .
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,725
. . .who happens to be
your ex-best friend?
00:04:28,176 --> 00:04:30,326
All right, all right!
I know it's stupid.
00:04:30,576 --> 00:04:33,693
I'll go see him this afternoon
and I'll put an end to it.
00:04:40,616 --> 00:04:43,926
I'm not crazy, right?
I mean, it was never like that.
00:04:44,376 --> 00:04:46,128
No, it wasn't!
00:04:49,776 --> 00:04:52,529
It was so nice
having this little sink here.
00:04:56,976 --> 00:04:59,934
''Oh, Danielle,
I wasn't expecting the machine.
00:05:01,896 --> 00:05:04,330
Give me a call
when you get a chance. ''
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:08,131
Bye-bye.
00:05:09,016 --> 00:05:10,131
Oh, God!
00:05:12,176 --> 00:05:15,373
That's what you've been working on
for the past two hours?
00:05:15,976 --> 00:05:16,806
I've been honing.
00:05:18,536 --> 00:05:19,651
What was with the dishes?
00:05:19,856 --> 00:05:22,734
I wanted her to think
I might be in a restaurant. . .
00:05:22,976 --> 00:05:26,935
. . .you know, I might have a life.
Like I haven't been sitting here. . .
00:05:27,136 --> 00:05:29,206
. . .honing for the last two hours?
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:31,686
The guy with the telescope
is doing it again!
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:33,534
Oh, my God!
00:05:35,216 --> 00:05:38,845
Go away!
Stop looking in here!
00:05:39,096 --> 00:05:41,326
Great.
Now he's waving back.
00:05:42,816 --> 00:05:44,374
We gotta do something about him.
00:05:44,616 --> 00:05:46,811
I caught him looking
into our apartment.
00:05:47,016 --> 00:05:49,530
It creeps me out!
I feel like I can't do stuff.
00:05:50,376 --> 00:05:52,128
What kind of stuff?
00:05:54,176 --> 00:05:56,929
Will you grow up?
I'm not talking about sexy stuff. . .
00:05:57,136 --> 00:05:59,650
. . .but, like,
when I'm cooking naked.
00:06:01,896 --> 00:06:03,045
You cook naked?
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:06,527
Yeah, toast, oatmeal.
Nothing that spatters.
00:06:09,696 --> 00:06:12,335
What are you looking at me for?
I didn't know that.
00:06:14,576 --> 00:06:15,929
What's the matter?
00:06:16,616 --> 00:06:19,130
I just--
Oh, Barry, this was not good.
00:06:19,336 --> 00:06:22,169
No, it was.
It was very, very good.
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:23,965
What about Mindy?
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:25,768
Oh, way better than Mindy.
00:06:27,936 --> 00:06:30,575
Not that! I mean,
what about you and Mindy?
00:06:31,176 --> 00:06:33,974
Oh. If you want, I'll just
break it off with her.
00:06:35,616 --> 00:06:37,925
No, don't do that.
Not for me.
00:06:38,176 --> 00:06:41,532
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush
is here for his adjustment.
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:42,652
Thanks, Bernice.
00:06:43,976 --> 00:06:45,728
Let's go away this weekend.
00:06:46,736 --> 00:06:48,169
Come on.
This is all way too--
00:06:48,496 --> 00:06:49,929
No, we can go to Aruba.
00:06:50,736 --> 00:06:53,728
When I went there on what
would've been our honeymoon. . .
00:06:53,936 --> 00:06:56,769
. . .it was really nice.
You would've liked it.
00:06:59,016 --> 00:07:00,529
I had a bra.
00:07:11,896 --> 00:07:12,806
Hey, Dr. Farber.
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:16,531
All right, Miss Greene,
everything looks fine.
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,496
We're starting to see
some real progress here.
00:07:22,736 --> 00:07:23,532
What?
00:07:24,016 --> 00:07:26,132
I'm 12, I'm not stupid.
00:07:36,016 --> 00:07:37,529
Can I use your phone?
00:07:38,216 --> 00:07:40,730
For future reference,
that thing in your hand. . .
00:07:40,936 --> 00:07:42,733
. . .can also be used as a phone.
00:07:46,616 --> 00:07:47,890
Yes, it's working.
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,455
Why isn't she calling back?
00:07:52,016 --> 00:07:53,449
Maybe she never got your message.
00:07:53,656 --> 00:07:56,932
You could call her machine,
and if she has a lot of beeps. . .
00:07:57,136 --> 00:07:59,206
. . .that means she didn't get
her messages yet.
00:08:00,016 --> 00:08:01,335
Doesn't that make me seem--?
00:08:01,576 --> 00:08:03,612
Desperate? Needy?
Pathetic?
00:08:04,536 --> 00:08:06,925
You obviously saw my personal ad.
00:08:09,896 --> 00:08:10,692
How many beeps?
00:08:10,896 --> 00:08:12,329
She answered.
00:08:14,096 --> 00:08:17,247
This is where you'd use
that ''hello'' word we talked about.
00:08:18,096 --> 00:08:20,530
I won't talk to her.
She obviously got my message. . .
00:08:20,776 --> 00:08:24,007
. . .and is choosing not to call me.
Now I'm needy and snubbed.
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,532
God, I miss just being needy!
00:08:30,136 --> 00:08:31,569
So how'd he take it?
00:08:31,896 --> 00:08:34,126
Pretty well, actually.
00:08:36,976 --> 00:08:39,934
How come you have
dental floss in your hair?
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:42,569
Oh, do I?
00:08:45,256 --> 00:08:47,326
We ended up having sex in his chair.
00:08:48,176 --> 00:08:49,734
You had sex in his chair?
00:08:54,376 --> 00:08:56,936
I said that a little
too loudly, didn't I?
00:08:58,216 --> 00:08:59,729
You had what?
00:09:01,016 --> 00:09:02,893
Sex in his chair.
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:06,092
What. . . .
00:09:06,776 --> 00:09:08,129
What were you thinking?
00:09:08,336 --> 00:09:11,294
I don't know.
We still care about each other.
00:09:11,816 --> 00:09:14,376
There's a history there.
It's like you and Carol.
00:09:17,136 --> 00:09:19,127
It's nothing like me and Carol.
00:09:19,336 --> 00:09:23,170
Please! If she said to you,
''Ross, I want you on this couch. . .
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,532
. . .right here, right now,''
what would you say?
00:09:27,816 --> 00:09:29,932
If it helps I could slide over.
00:09:32,176 --> 00:09:34,736
It's a totally different situation.
00:09:34,936 --> 00:09:38,053
It's apples and oranges.
It's orthodontists and lesbians--
00:09:38,296 --> 00:09:39,092
I gotta go.
00:09:40,976 --> 00:09:43,126
-Where are you going?
-I just have to go!
00:09:43,336 --> 00:09:46,533
Do I need a reason?
I have things to do with my life.
00:09:46,736 --> 00:09:48,931
I have a jam-packed schedule.
00:09:49,136 --> 00:09:52,526
And I am late for keeping up
with it, okay?
00:10:05,976 --> 00:10:06,931
Mindy.
00:10:08,736 --> 00:10:10,328
How are you?
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:14,564
Yes, I heard. Congratulations!
That is so great!
00:10:14,816 --> 00:10:16,727
Really, oh, God--
00:10:19,136 --> 00:10:20,455
I'm working tomorrow. . .
00:10:20,656 --> 00:10:23,932
. . .but if you want, you can come by
if you'd like.
00:10:25,616 --> 00:10:26,731
Great!
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,771
So I'll see you tomorrow.
00:10:33,896 --> 00:10:34,772
Bye.
00:10:36,496 --> 00:10:38,134
Oh, God! Oh, God!
00:10:40,616 --> 00:10:42,174
So how's Mindy?
00:10:43,736 --> 00:10:45,374
She wants to see me tomorrow.
00:10:45,616 --> 00:10:47,607
She sounded weird.
I gotta call Barry.
00:10:52,216 --> 00:10:53,774
It's me. I just--
00:10:53,976 --> 00:10:54,772
Mindy!
00:10:56,176 --> 00:10:57,165
Mindy!
00:10:57,896 --> 00:10:59,488
No, I figured
that's where you'd be.
00:11:15,536 --> 00:11:18,175
Hell is filled
with people like you.
00:11:21,096 --> 00:11:22,768
He's back.
The peeper's back.
00:11:23,936 --> 00:11:25,654
-Get down!
-Get down?
00:11:26,096 --> 00:11:27,211
And boogie.
00:11:29,136 --> 00:11:32,526
Thanks, but I gotta go and get
my eyes scratched out by Mindy.
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,289
Relax. She may not even know.
00:11:34,576 --> 00:11:37,773
I haven't heard from her
in seven months, and now she calls me.
00:11:38,056 --> 00:11:39,933
I mean, what else is it about?
00:11:40,136 --> 00:11:42,092
She was my best friend, you guys.
00:11:42,296 --> 00:11:43,934
We went to camp together. . .
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,933
. . .she taught me how to kiss. . . .
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:51,574
Now, you know,
I'm, like, the other woman!
00:11:51,776 --> 00:11:52,925
I feel so--
00:11:53,176 --> 00:11:54,529
Naughty!
00:11:56,496 --> 00:11:58,964
-I'll see you guys later.
-I'll walk out with you.
00:11:59,216 --> 00:12:01,252
When she taught you to kiss,
you were at camp. . .
00:12:01,496 --> 00:12:04,533
. . .and were you wearing
any kind of little uniform or--?
00:12:06,376 --> 00:12:07,934
That's fine, yeah.
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,850
I'm going to the bathroom.
Will you watch my phone?
00:12:12,096 --> 00:12:13,165
Why not take it with you?
00:12:14,096 --> 00:12:16,974
We haven't been on a second date.
She needs to hear me pee?
00:12:17,256 --> 00:12:18,735
Why don't you just call her?
00:12:18,976 --> 00:12:21,968
I can't call her. I left a message.
I have some pride.
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:23,052
-Do you?
-No!
00:12:30,176 --> 00:12:31,609
Danielle, hi!
00:12:31,816 --> 00:12:33,772
It's Chandler.
00:12:34,016 --> 00:12:35,335
I'm fine.
00:12:36,976 --> 00:12:37,772
Listen. . . .
00:12:37,976 --> 00:12:41,525
I don't know if you tried to call me
because, idiot that I am. . .
00:12:41,736 --> 00:12:43,931
. . .I accidentally shut off my phone.
00:12:47,216 --> 00:12:49,650
That's fine. That's great. Okay.
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,530
She's on the other line.
She's gonna call me back.
00:12:54,536 --> 00:12:58,245
She's on the other line,
she's gonna call me back!
00:12:58,536 --> 00:13:00,652
-Don't you have to pee?
-That's why I'm dancing.
00:13:05,856 --> 00:13:06,652
Mindy.
00:13:07,016 --> 00:13:07,971
Hey, you.
00:13:08,616 --> 00:13:09,412
Hey, you.
00:13:13,816 --> 00:13:14,965
So what's up?
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,247
We should really be sitting for this.
00:13:19,976 --> 00:13:21,375
Sure we should.
00:13:29,736 --> 00:13:30,532
So. . . .
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,336
Now, I know things have
been weird lately.
00:13:33,536 --> 00:13:36,494
But you're my oldest friend,
except for Laurie Schaefer. . .
00:13:36,696 --> 00:13:37,970
. . .who I don't talk to anymore. . .
00:13:38,216 --> 00:13:40,650
. . .because she's bitter
that she lost the weight. . .
00:13:40,856 --> 00:13:43,086
. . .and it turns out,
she doesn't have a pretty face.
00:13:45,456 --> 00:13:48,607
I'll just ask you this once,
and I want a straight answer.
00:13:52,216 --> 00:13:53,934
Will you be my maid of honor?
00:13:57,896 --> 00:13:58,772
Of course!
00:13:58,976 --> 00:13:59,772
That's so great!
00:14:00,616 --> 00:14:01,685
It is! It is!
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:05,132
-That's all you wanted to ask?
-That's all!
00:14:09,136 --> 00:14:10,649
What?
00:14:11,056 --> 00:14:11,852
That's not all.
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,326
Oh, sure it is!
00:14:14,576 --> 00:14:16,328
Oh, no, it isn't!
00:14:17,976 --> 00:14:20,251
I think Barry's seeing someone
in the city.
00:14:21,936 --> 00:14:23,654
What would make you think that?
00:14:23,976 --> 00:14:26,774
Ever since we announced
the engagement, he's acted weird.
00:14:27,016 --> 00:14:30,406
And then last night, he came home
smelling like Chanel!
00:14:32,736 --> 00:14:33,532
Really?
00:14:35,616 --> 00:14:37,925
If it'll make you feel any better. . .
00:14:38,176 --> 00:14:41,452
. . .when Barry and I got engaged,
he went through a weird thing too.
00:14:41,656 --> 00:14:43,851
Oh, God!
That's what I was afraid of.
00:14:44,056 --> 00:14:46,570
What's what you were afraid of?
00:14:48,016 --> 00:14:52,532
When Barry was engaged to you,
he and I. . .
00:14:52,736 --> 00:14:56,365
. . .kind of had
a little thing on the side.
00:14:57,256 --> 00:14:58,052
What?
00:14:58,256 --> 00:14:59,325
I know, I know.
00:14:59,576 --> 00:15:01,726
When he proposed to me,
everyone said, ''Don't do it.
00:15:01,976 --> 00:15:03,728
He'll do to you
what he did to Rachel. ''
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:05,608
And now I feel so stupid.
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,295
You are so stupid.
00:15:14,816 --> 00:15:16,727
We are both so stupid.
00:15:16,976 --> 00:15:18,125
What do you mean?
00:15:20,656 --> 00:15:21,930
Smell familiar?
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,569
Oh, I'm so sorry.
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:29,411
Oh, no, me.
I am so sorry.
00:15:29,616 --> 00:15:31,572
No, I am sorry.
I'm sorry.
00:15:45,136 --> 00:15:46,535
Oh, my!
00:15:48,776 --> 00:15:51,131
Four letters, ''circle or hoop. ''
00:15:51,376 --> 00:15:52,604
Ring, damn it, ring!
00:15:52,816 --> 00:15:54,135
Thanks.
00:15:57,136 --> 00:15:58,615
You know our phone's not working?
00:15:58,856 --> 00:16:00,130
What?
00:16:01,096 --> 00:16:02,768
I called from the coffee shop.
00:16:02,976 --> 00:16:05,729
-There was no answer.
-I turned it off.
00:16:05,936 --> 00:16:08,006
Mother of God, I turned it off!
00:16:08,656 --> 00:16:09,975
Just like you told her you did.
00:16:11,936 --> 00:16:13,415
Just pointing out the irony.
00:16:14,816 --> 00:16:17,455
I went across the street
and talked to the doorman.
00:16:17,816 --> 00:16:20,284
I got the peeper's name.
Can I use the phone?
00:16:22,616 --> 00:16:23,810
Can I use your phone?
00:16:27,816 --> 00:16:30,376
The number for a Sidney Marks, please.
00:16:30,736 --> 00:16:32,215
''Heating device. ''
00:16:33,336 --> 00:16:34,371
Radiator.
00:16:34,616 --> 00:16:35,935
Five letters.
00:16:36,336 --> 00:16:37,735
''Rdtor. ''
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:43,928
Yeah, is Sidney there?
00:16:45,176 --> 00:16:45,972
Oh, this is?
00:16:46,936 --> 00:16:47,846
Sidney's a woman.
00:16:48,056 --> 00:16:49,614
So she's a woman, so what?
00:16:50,216 --> 00:16:51,968
Yeah, so what?
00:16:52,296 --> 00:16:56,175
I live across the street, and I know
all about you and your telescope.
00:16:56,536 --> 00:16:58,254
And I don't appreciate it, okay?
00:16:58,456 --> 00:17:01,050
Yeah, I can see you right now.
Hello?
00:17:01,496 --> 00:17:04,249
If I wanna walk around my apartment
in my underwear. . .
00:17:04,496 --> 00:17:06,134
. . .I shouldn't have to feel--
00:17:06,336 --> 00:17:07,166
Thank you.
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:11,648
That's not really the point.
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:13,375
The point is, that--
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:16,130
Mostly free-weights,
but occasionally--
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,976
Yeah, my neighbor.
Yeah, the brunette.
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,884
She said you looked pretty that day
in the green dress.
00:17:26,216 --> 00:17:27,444
The green dress?
00:17:27,696 --> 00:17:28,492
Really?
00:17:28,696 --> 00:17:30,652
She said you looked like
Ingrid Bergman.
00:17:39,936 --> 00:17:41,733
-You got a second?
-Sure, sure.
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:42,925
Come on. . .
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:44,292
. . .in.
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,054
Hello, sweetheart.
00:17:46,896 --> 00:17:48,568
What you guys doing here?
00:17:48,816 --> 00:17:51,455
We are here to break up with you.
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:53,771
Both of you?
00:17:54,136 --> 00:17:58,049
We think you're a horrible human being,
and bad things should happen to you.
00:18:00,616 --> 00:18:02,652
I'm sorry.
God, I am so sorry!
00:18:02,896 --> 00:18:05,171
I'm an idiot! I was weak!
I couldn't help myself.
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:08,294
Whatever I did, I only did
because I love you so much.
00:18:10,696 --> 00:18:12,891
Which one of us
are you talking to there?
00:18:15,816 --> 00:18:16,931
Mindy.
00:18:17,136 --> 00:18:19,650
Of course, Mindy!
It was always Mindy.
00:18:19,976 --> 00:18:22,206
Even when we were having sex
in that chair?
00:18:22,656 --> 00:18:25,887
I swear, whatever I was doing,
I was always thinking of you.
00:18:26,096 --> 00:18:27,768
Oh, please!
00:18:28,016 --> 00:18:31,326
During that second time, you couldn't
have picked her out of a lineup!
00:18:31,536 --> 00:18:32,446
You did it twice?
00:18:33,576 --> 00:18:35,931
The first time didn't count.
You know, it was Barry.
00:18:36,176 --> 00:18:37,052
Oh, right.
00:18:38,176 --> 00:18:39,768
Honey, baby, sweetheart, look. . . .
00:18:39,976 --> 00:18:41,773
Just give me another chance.
00:18:41,976 --> 00:18:44,854
We'll start all over again.
We'll go back to Aruba.
00:18:46,696 --> 00:18:47,924
What do you say?
00:18:48,216 --> 00:18:50,776
Dr. Farber, we've got
an emergency here.
00:18:51,016 --> 00:18:53,576
Jason Castalano's choking
on his retainer.
00:18:53,816 --> 00:18:56,455
Oh, God!
I'll be right there, Bernice.
00:18:56,696 --> 00:18:58,732
Look, please don't go anywhere.
00:18:58,936 --> 00:19:00,733
I'll be right back.
00:19:02,296 --> 00:19:05,094
Okay, and we'll be here,
hating you!
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,006
See how he was sweating
when he walked out?
00:19:09,096 --> 00:19:12,247
If I'm hogging the ball too much,
you jump right in there. . .
00:19:12,456 --> 00:19:15,016
. . .and take a couple of punches.
This feels great!
00:19:16,376 --> 00:19:18,890
I'm pretty sure
I'm still gonna marry him.
00:19:19,976 --> 00:19:22,046
What are you talking about?
00:19:22,296 --> 00:19:24,969
Mindy, the guy is the devil!
00:19:25,176 --> 00:19:27,167
He is Satan in a smock!
00:19:27,896 --> 00:19:29,693
Look, I know he's not perfect.
00:19:33,216 --> 00:19:35,525
But the truth is
at the end of the day. . .
00:19:35,736 --> 00:19:37,966
. . .I still really wanna be. . .
00:19:38,216 --> 00:19:41,333
. . .Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber. . .
00:19:42,016 --> 00:19:43,927
. . .D.D.S.
00:19:44,536 --> 00:19:45,730
Oh, God!
00:19:46,456 --> 00:19:49,653
I hope you can find some way
to be happy for me.
00:19:49,896 --> 00:19:52,205
And I hope you'll still be
my maid of honor.
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:56,328
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you
and eat you in Aruba.
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:04,729
You okay?
00:20:07,296 --> 00:20:08,524
Really?
00:20:11,016 --> 00:20:13,450
Ever since I ran out on Barry
at the wedding. . .
00:20:13,696 --> 00:20:16,335
. . .I have wondered whether I made
the right choice.
00:20:17,296 --> 00:20:18,775
And now I know.
00:20:19,816 --> 00:20:21,329
I'm so glad.
00:20:25,376 --> 00:20:26,934
Big day.
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:38,647
All right, I'll give you this:
Mr. Peanut is a better dresser.
00:20:38,896 --> 00:20:41,729
I mean, he's got the monocle,
he's got the top hat. . . .
00:20:41,936 --> 00:20:43,528
Did you know he's gay?
00:20:46,776 --> 00:20:50,530
I just wanna clarify this.
Are you outing Mr. Peanut?
00:20:53,136 --> 00:20:54,535
Danielle, hi!
00:20:54,736 --> 00:20:57,773
Everybody, this is Danielle.
Danielle, everybody.
00:20:58,656 --> 00:20:59,645
Why are you here?
00:20:59,856 --> 00:21:02,848
I've been calling you, but it
turns out I had your number wrong.
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:06,168
And when I finally got the right one,
there was no answer.
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:09,453
So I thought I'd come down here
and make sure you were okay.
00:21:11,016 --> 00:21:11,971
I'm okay.
00:21:12,216 --> 00:21:14,730
Listen, maybe we
could get together later?
00:21:15,216 --> 00:21:18,094
That sounds good. I'll call you.
Or you call me, whatever.
00:21:19,576 --> 00:21:20,725
You got it!
00:21:20,976 --> 00:21:21,806
Bye, everybody.
00:21:25,296 --> 00:21:26,172
There you go.
00:21:26,376 --> 00:21:28,094
Second date!
00:21:28,296 --> 00:21:29,524
I don't know.
00:21:30,136 --> 00:21:31,205
You don't know?
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:34,852
She seems nice, but that thing about
her coming all the way here. . .
00:21:35,096 --> 00:21:38,406
. . .just to see if I was okay?
I mean, how needy is that?
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
