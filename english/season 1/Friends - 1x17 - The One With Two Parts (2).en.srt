The One With the Two Parts - Part II
Previously on Friends. . . .
00:00:04,532 --> 00:00:05,965
-Excuse me.
-It's Phoebe!
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,163
-WiII that be aII?
-They're twins.
00:00:08,372 --> 00:00:10,761
Phoebe's Phoebe. Ursula's hot!
00:00:10,972 --> 00:00:11,768
It's for Ursula.
00:00:11,972 --> 00:00:14,532
Sure, yeah. Okay, it fits.
00:00:14,732 --> 00:00:16,404
Marcel, give Rossy the remote.
00:00:18,932 --> 00:00:20,206
How did he do this?
00:00:20,412 --> 00:00:22,642
It's this whole stupid Ursula thing.
00:00:22,892 --> 00:00:25,929
So he's going out with her.
Is it really so terrible?
00:00:26,132 --> 00:00:28,282
-You don't know my sister.
-Talk to Joey.
00:00:28,492 --> 00:00:31,211
-He's falling in love with her.
-You won't lose him.
00:00:31,412 --> 00:00:34,722
They haven't even slept together yet.
That's not serious.
00:00:38,932 --> 00:00:40,126
May we help you?
00:00:41,532 --> 00:00:42,965
Rachel! Rachel!
00:00:43,292 --> 00:00:45,328
I'm okay! I'm okay!
00:00:45,852 --> 00:00:46,841

00:00:52,732 --> 00:00:55,292
My friend was taking down
our Christmas lights. . .
00:00:55,492 --> 00:00:58,609
. . .and she fell off the balcony
and may have broken her ankle.
00:00:58,812 --> 00:01:01,280
My God, you still have
your Christmas lights up?
00:01:03,612 --> 00:01:05,284
Fill this out and bring it back.
00:01:05,692 --> 00:01:06,841
Here you go.
00:01:12,212 --> 00:01:13,327
All right.
00:01:13,652 --> 00:01:14,971
Name. . .
00:01:15,212 --> 00:01:16,406
. . .address. . . .
00:01:17,892 --> 00:01:19,689
In case of emergency, call. . .?
00:01:19,932 --> 00:01:21,047
You.
00:01:21,612 --> 00:01:22,408
Really?
00:01:24,492 --> 00:01:26,084
Oh, that is so sweet!
00:01:28,132 --> 00:01:30,168
Oh, gosh. I love you.
00:01:30,412 --> 00:01:31,845
Okay, insurance?
00:01:32,132 --> 00:01:34,930
Yeah, check it.
Definitely gonna want some of that!
00:01:36,252 --> 00:01:37,480
You don't have insurance?
00:01:37,732 --> 00:01:39,245
Why? How much will this cost?
00:01:39,492 --> 00:01:42,131
X-rays alone could be
a couple hundred dollars!
00:01:42,332 --> 00:01:44,687
-What'll we do?
-There's not much we can do.
00:01:47,132 --> 00:01:49,248
Unless I use yours.
00:01:52,252 --> 00:01:53,401
Now wait a second.
00:01:53,612 --> 00:01:56,684
Who did I just put as my
''in case of emergency'' person?
00:01:57,092 --> 00:01:58,605
That's insurance fraud.
00:02:00,252 --> 00:02:03,403
All right then, forget it.
Might as well just go home.
00:02:06,372 --> 00:02:09,648
-Okay, come here. I hate this.
-Thank you. I love you.
00:02:11,892 --> 00:02:14,804
I'm gonna need
a new set of these forms.
00:02:15,492 --> 00:02:16,288
Why?
00:02:17,612 --> 00:02:19,648
I am really an idiot!
00:02:21,252 --> 00:02:23,083
I was filling out my friend's form. . .
00:02:23,292 --> 00:02:25,362
. . .and instead of putting
her information. . .
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:26,806
. . .I put mine.
00:02:27,132 --> 00:02:28,850
You are an idiot.
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:32,843
Yep, that's me.
I am that stupid.
00:02:34,812 --> 00:02:37,690
I had a dream that I was
playing football with my kid.
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,686
That's nice.
00:02:40,052 --> 00:02:41,644
No, no. With him.
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:47,724
I'm on this field,
and they hike me the baby.
00:02:49,372 --> 00:02:52,967
I've gotta do something because the
Tampa Bay team's coming right at me!
00:02:54,212 --> 00:02:56,248
Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
00:02:57,132 --> 00:02:58,451
Right, but. . .
00:02:59,652 --> 00:03:03,440
. . .it is just me and the baby,
so I'm thinking they can take us.
00:03:05,212 --> 00:03:06,725
And so, I. . .
00:03:07,332 --> 00:03:08,845
. . .I just heave it downfield!
00:03:09,092 --> 00:03:10,889
What are you, crazy?
That's a baby!
00:03:11,092 --> 00:03:13,242
He should take the sack?
00:03:16,692 --> 00:03:17,647
Anyway. . .
00:03:17,892 --> 00:03:19,962
. . .suddenly I'm downfield.
00:03:20,212 --> 00:03:23,887
And I realize that I'm the one
who's suppose to catch him, right?
00:03:24,132 --> 00:03:26,726
Only I know I'm not gonna
get there in time.
00:03:26,932 --> 00:03:28,684
So I am running and I'm running. . .
00:03:28,892 --> 00:03:30,484
. . .and that is when I woke up.
00:03:30,732 --> 00:03:33,963
See, I am so not ready
to be a father.
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,003
Hey, you're gonna be fine.
00:03:36,212 --> 00:03:39,443
You're one of the most caring,
responsible men in North America.
00:03:40,932 --> 00:03:42,684
You're gonna make a great dad.
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:46,368
Yeah, Ross. You and the baby
just need better blocking.
00:03:50,292 --> 00:03:53,250
Have you ever been to the
Rainbow Room? Is it expensive?
00:03:53,492 --> 00:03:55,084
Only if you order stuff.
00:03:56,692 --> 00:03:59,286
I'm taking Ursula tonight.
It's her birthday.
00:03:59,492 --> 00:04:02,450
-What about Phoebe's birthday?
-When's that?
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:05,208
Tonight.
00:04:06,052 --> 00:04:08,646
Man, what are the odds
of that happening?
00:04:10,732 --> 00:04:12,370
You take your time.
00:04:17,652 --> 00:04:18,767
There it is!
00:04:22,612 --> 00:04:23,522
What'll you do?
00:04:24,332 --> 00:04:28,041
What can I do? I don't want
to screw it up with Ursula.
00:04:28,292 --> 00:04:29,281
And your friend, Phoebe?
00:04:29,532 --> 00:04:33,241
If she's my friend, she'll understand.
Wouldn't you guys?
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,484
If you tried that on my birthday. . .
00:04:35,732 --> 00:04:38,849
. . .you'd be staring at
the business end of a hissy fit.
00:04:41,332 --> 00:04:44,244
An added pinch of saffron
makes all the difference.
00:04:49,452 --> 00:04:50,248
Monica?
00:04:50,492 --> 00:04:51,288
Yes?
00:04:51,732 --> 00:04:53,529
Yes, she is.
00:04:54,332 --> 00:04:56,163
This is my friend, Rachel.
00:04:56,372 --> 00:04:57,851
Hi, I'm Dr. Mitchell.
00:04:58,052 --> 00:05:00,441
And I'm his friend, Dr. Rosen.
00:05:01,332 --> 00:05:03,243
Aren't you a little cute
to be a doctor?
00:05:03,452 --> 00:05:04,646
Excuse me?
00:05:04,892 --> 00:05:06,689
God, young, young.
I meant young.
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,684
Young to be a doctor.
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,247
-Good, Rach.
-Thank you.
00:05:21,492 --> 00:05:23,642
He said it was a sprain,
and that was it.
00:05:23,852 --> 00:05:26,047
You left out the stupid part.
00:05:26,732 --> 00:05:27,687
It's not stupid.
00:05:27,932 --> 00:05:32,084
The very cute doctors asked us out
for tomorrow night, and I said yes.
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,449
I think it's totally insane.
They work for the hospital.
00:05:35,652 --> 00:05:38,450
It's like returning
to the scene of the crime.
00:05:39,052 --> 00:05:42,886
-I say we blow off the dates.
-What? Monica, they are cute.
00:05:43,132 --> 00:05:46,602
They are doctors. Cute doctors.
Doctors who are cute.
00:05:47,052 --> 00:05:49,441
All right, what have
we learned so far?
00:05:51,612 --> 00:05:52,488
Oh, God.
00:05:58,332 --> 00:05:59,560
Surprise!
00:06:06,932 --> 00:06:09,651
What are you doing?
You scared the crap out of me!
00:06:11,332 --> 00:06:13,163
-Was that the cake?
-Yeah.
00:06:13,612 --> 00:06:15,648
I got a lemon schmush.
00:06:16,212 --> 00:06:18,248
Come on.
She'll be here any minute.
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,245
I hope it's okay.
00:06:24,412 --> 00:06:26,209
''Happy Birthday, Peehee. ''
00:06:28,132 --> 00:06:30,487
Maybe we can make
a ''B'' out of a rose.
00:06:30,692 --> 00:06:33,047
Yeah, we'll just use
our special cake tools.
00:06:34,132 --> 00:06:35,485
-What's going on?
-We just--
00:06:35,732 --> 00:06:37,245
Surprise!
00:06:40,572 --> 00:06:42,290
This is so great!
00:06:43,652 --> 00:06:45,483
This was not at all scary.
00:06:45,932 --> 00:06:47,331
Hi, everybody. Hi, Betty!
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,726
Betty, hi!
00:06:48,932 --> 00:06:52,083
You found Betty!
Oh, my gosh! This is so great.
00:06:52,332 --> 00:06:55,563
Everybody I love is in the same room.
00:06:55,812 --> 00:06:57,404
Where's Joey?
00:07:00,132 --> 00:07:01,485
Did you see Betty?
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:15,127
I wouldn't mind having a piece
of this sun-dried tomato business.
00:07:15,892 --> 00:07:20,090
Years ago, if somebody'd said, ''Here's
a tomato that looks like a prune'' . . .
00:07:20,292 --> 00:07:22,567
. . .I'd have said,
''Get out of my office! ''
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,531
Dad, before I was born,
did you freak out at all?
00:07:28,732 --> 00:07:31,041
I'm not freaking out!
I'm just saying. . .
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:33,726
. . .if someone had come to me
with the idea--
00:07:34,012 --> 00:07:36,890
I'm talking about
the whole baby thing.
00:07:37,092 --> 00:07:39,845
Did you ever get this sort of. . .
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:44,449
. . .panicky, ''Oh, my God, I'm gonna
be a father'' kind of a thing?
00:07:46,452 --> 00:07:49,364
Your mother did the work.
I was busy with the business.
00:07:49,612 --> 00:07:51,364
I wasn't around that much.
00:07:51,612 --> 00:07:53,489
Is that what this is about?
00:07:53,692 --> 00:07:55,364
No, no. I was just wondering.
00:07:55,572 --> 00:07:58,882
There's time to make up for that.
We can do stuff together.
00:07:59,132 --> 00:08:03,330
You always wanted to go to coIonial
Williamsburg. How about we do that?
00:08:03,932 --> 00:08:05,684
Thanks, Dad, really.
00:08:05,932 --> 00:08:08,446
You know, I just, I just. . . .
00:08:09,092 --> 00:08:11,287
I just needed to know. . .
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:14,450
. . .when did you start
to feel like a father?
00:08:15,892 --> 00:08:20,522
Well, I guess it must have been
the day after you were born.
00:08:21,132 --> 00:08:24,044
We were in the hospital room,
your mother was asleep. . .
00:08:24,292 --> 00:08:27,921
. . .and they brought you in
and gave you to me.
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:31,249
You were this ugly little red thing!
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:35,651
And all of a sudden, you grabbed
my finger with your whole fist. . .
00:08:35,892 --> 00:08:37,371
. . .and you squeezed it. . .
00:08:37,612 --> 00:08:39,250
. . .so tight.
00:08:41,052 --> 00:08:42,849
And that's when I knew.
00:08:45,812 --> 00:08:48,610
So you don't want to go
to Williamsburg?
00:08:51,812 --> 00:08:53,643
We can go to Williamsburg.
00:08:54,932 --> 00:08:56,445
Eat your fish.
00:09:00,532 --> 00:09:02,762
Rachel, the cute doctors are here!
00:09:03,012 --> 00:09:04,365
Okay, coming.
00:09:04,812 --> 00:09:07,121
Hi, come on in.
Hey, Michael, Jeffrey.
00:09:08,532 --> 00:09:09,408
We brought wine.
00:09:09,612 --> 00:09:14,049
Look at this. It's from the cellars
of Ernest and Tova Borgnine.
00:09:14,332 --> 00:09:16,368
-How could we resist?
-That's great!
00:09:17,012 --> 00:09:19,048
-So, Monica, how's the ankle?
-It's. . . .
00:09:21,452 --> 00:09:23,249
Why don't you tell them?
00:09:23,652 --> 00:09:25,324
After all, it is your ankle.
00:09:25,852 --> 00:09:28,650
It's feeling a lot better.
Thank you.
00:09:28,892 --> 00:09:32,441
Why don't you guys sit down,
and we'll get you some glasses.
00:09:34,132 --> 00:09:35,042
Stat!
00:09:38,732 --> 00:09:41,883
Listen, why don't we just
tell them who we really are?
00:09:42,132 --> 00:09:45,841
-I think it'll be fine.
-It will not. We'll get in trouble.
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,883
Would you stop being such a wuss!
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:51,761
A wuss? Excuse me
for living in the real world.
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,287
-So?
-So they still seem normal.
00:09:54,532 --> 00:09:55,681
Because they are.
00:09:55,892 --> 00:09:58,281
When we go out with women
we meet at the hospital--
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:00,727
Would you relax?
Take a look around.
00:10:01,332 --> 00:10:04,051
There are no pagan altars.
00:10:05,092 --> 00:10:07,845
No piles of bones in the corners.
00:10:08,052 --> 00:10:10,122
They're fine. Go like this:
00:10:13,852 --> 00:10:17,731
We are not going to do it, okay?
Sometimes you can be such a big baby!
00:10:17,932 --> 00:10:19,490
-I am not a baby.
-Be serious.
00:10:19,692 --> 00:10:21,762
-You get uptight--
-You act like a princess.
00:10:21,972 --> 00:10:24,281
You know what? You know what?
00:10:24,492 --> 00:10:28,246
Every day you are becoming
more and more like your mother.
00:10:28,452 --> 00:10:29,851
Excuse me.
00:10:30,092 --> 00:10:31,241
Here we go.
00:10:32,692 --> 00:10:35,160
This is a great place.
How long have you lived here?
00:10:35,372 --> 00:10:38,205
Thanks. I've been here
about six years.
00:10:38,412 --> 00:10:41,449
And Rachel moved in a few months ago.
00:10:42,412 --> 00:10:44,880
See, I was supposed to get married. . .
00:10:45,092 --> 00:10:47,048
. . .but I left the guy at the altar.
00:10:52,332 --> 00:10:54,926
Yeah, I know
it's pretty selfish, but. . .
00:10:55,172 --> 00:10:57,447
. . .hey, that's me!
00:11:01,612 --> 00:11:03,250
Why don't you try the hummus?
00:11:03,492 --> 00:11:04,720
Monica, what do you do?
00:11:05,892 --> 00:11:08,087
I am a chef at a restaurant uptown.
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,088
Good for you.
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:10,645
Yeah, it is.
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:16,642
Mostly because I get to boss people
around, which I just love to do.
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,604
Well, this hummus is great.
00:11:20,812 --> 00:11:22,450
God bless the chickpea.
00:11:27,132 --> 00:11:28,281
Oh, God!
00:11:28,492 --> 00:11:30,847
I am so spoiled!
00:11:34,932 --> 00:11:35,921
That's it.
00:11:37,532 --> 00:11:40,046
And have I mentioned that
back in high school. . .
00:11:40,252 --> 00:11:41,571
. . .I was a cow?
00:11:43,812 --> 00:11:45,848
I used to wet my bed.
00:11:46,692 --> 00:11:49,411
I use my breasts to get
other people's attention.
00:11:49,732 --> 00:11:51,450
We both do that!
00:12:05,212 --> 00:12:07,851
Monica and Rachel's apartment.
00:12:09,292 --> 00:12:11,886
Just one second.
Rachel, it's your dad.
00:12:14,732 --> 00:12:15,926
Hi, Dad.
00:12:16,132 --> 00:12:18,043
No, no. It's me.
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:21,646
Listen, Dad,
I can't talk right now.
00:12:21,852 --> 00:12:23,843
But there's something. . . .
00:12:24,052 --> 00:12:26,771
There's something
I've been meaning to tell you.
00:12:27,452 --> 00:12:28,248
Excuse me.
00:12:28,652 --> 00:12:30,608
Remember back in freshman year?
00:12:30,812 --> 00:12:33,645
Well, Billy Dreskin and I
had sex on your bed.
00:12:44,052 --> 00:12:45,087
Daddy. . . .
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,885
Why? Why would I sleep
with Billy Dreskin?
00:12:49,132 --> 00:12:51,282
His father tried to put
you out of business!
00:12:51,532 --> 00:12:52,931
You are dead!
00:12:56,892 --> 00:12:59,087
Ross, he's got the remote again.
00:12:59,332 --> 00:13:00,447
Good.
00:13:01,412 --> 00:13:02,891
Maybe he can switch it back.
00:13:06,732 --> 00:13:07,881
Maybe not.
00:13:15,012 --> 00:13:18,288
Hold on a second and let me
just check and see if she's here.
00:13:18,492 --> 00:13:22,246
It's the woman from the hospital.
There's a problem with the form.
00:13:22,452 --> 00:13:24,090
Oh, God, what do we do?
00:13:24,332 --> 00:13:26,050
Just find out what they want.
00:13:26,292 --> 00:13:28,044
Okay. No, you do it.
00:13:28,732 --> 00:13:30,848
Hello. This is Monica.
00:13:34,892 --> 00:13:37,087
Yes, we'll be right down.
Thank you.
00:13:38,212 --> 00:13:40,851
We forgot to sign one
of the admissions forms.
00:13:41,492 --> 00:13:44,165
-You're right, this wasn't worth it.
-Thank you.
00:13:44,452 --> 00:13:46,044
Let me just change.
00:13:51,892 --> 00:13:52,927
Trouble?
00:13:54,132 --> 00:13:56,168
Your sister stood me up
the other night.
00:13:56,372 --> 00:13:59,842
Oh, no. Don't you hate it
when people aren't there for you?
00:14:01,732 --> 00:14:04,565
-Did you try calling her?
-I've been trying for two days.
00:14:04,812 --> 00:14:07,451
When I called the restaurant,
they said she was busy.
00:14:07,692 --> 00:14:10,252
I can't believe
she's blowing me off!
00:14:33,732 --> 00:14:35,290
You got a minute?
00:14:35,532 --> 00:14:38,251
Yeah, I'm just working.
00:14:49,892 --> 00:14:51,723
I got you a birthday present.
00:14:52,052 --> 00:14:53,451
Wow, you remembered!
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:01,088
It's a Judy Jetson thermos.
00:15:01,292 --> 00:15:02,520
Like the kind you--
00:15:02,732 --> 00:15:03,847
Right.
00:15:04,492 --> 00:15:06,562
Oh, I got something for you too.
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,649
How'd you know I was coming?
00:15:09,252 --> 00:15:11,129
Yeah, twin thing.
00:15:13,532 --> 00:15:15,523
I can't believe you did this.
00:15:15,732 --> 00:15:17,450
I can't believe you. . .
00:15:17,692 --> 00:15:19,250
. . .did this!
00:15:23,292 --> 00:15:25,408
So what's the deal
with you and Joey?
00:15:26,212 --> 00:15:27,486
Oh, right.
00:15:27,692 --> 00:15:30,365
He is so great.
But that's over.
00:15:31,292 --> 00:15:33,010
-Does he know?
-Who?
00:15:33,852 --> 00:15:38,289
Joey. You know, he's really nutsy
about you.
00:15:38,732 --> 00:15:40,165
He is? Why?
00:15:40,452 --> 00:15:41,441
You got me.
00:15:42,492 --> 00:15:43,481
Excuse me. . .
00:15:43,732 --> 00:15:46,246
. . .doesn't this come
with a side salad?
00:15:47,812 --> 00:15:49,564
So are you gonna call him?
00:15:49,772 --> 00:15:52,525
-You think he likes me?
-No. Joey.
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:57,447
No, no. He is so smart.
He'll figure it out.
00:15:57,692 --> 00:15:59,250
Do you want some chicken?
00:16:00,012 --> 00:16:02,242
No, no.
No food with a face, remember?
00:16:03,132 --> 00:16:05,168
You have not changed.
00:16:05,492 --> 00:16:06,845
Yeah, you too.
00:16:10,212 --> 00:16:11,691
Hi! Remember us?
00:16:13,452 --> 00:16:17,081
You just called about needing
a signature on the admissions form?
00:16:17,332 --> 00:16:19,687
Well, it turns out
we need a whole new one.
00:16:19,932 --> 00:16:21,888
Because, you see. . .
00:16:22,412 --> 00:16:24,448
. . .I put the wrong name again.
00:16:25,132 --> 00:16:27,851
-Because--
-You're that stupid!
00:16:29,052 --> 00:16:31,646
I am. I'm that stupid!
00:16:32,212 --> 00:16:34,601
And I'm just gonna pay
for this with a check.
00:16:35,012 --> 00:16:36,764
Your insurance will cover that.
00:16:36,972 --> 00:16:39,440
Yeah, I know.
I'm just not that bright either.
00:16:41,612 --> 00:16:43,011
Okay, worst case scenario:
00:16:43,332 --> 00:16:45,448
Say you never feel like a father.
00:16:46,652 --> 00:16:50,440
Say your son never feels
connected to you as one.
00:16:50,932 --> 00:16:54,402
Say all of his relationships
are affected by this.
00:16:54,612 --> 00:16:56,250
Do you have a point?
00:16:57,412 --> 00:16:59,243
You know, you'd think I would.
00:17:02,252 --> 00:17:04,049
What's up with the simian?
00:17:05,092 --> 00:17:07,048
It's just a fur ball.
00:17:08,932 --> 00:17:10,411
Whose turn is it?
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,489
Yours. I got
00:17:12,892 --> 00:17:16,089
No, you got
zero points for ''idney. ''
00:17:16,292 --> 00:17:18,522
I had a ''K. ''
Where's my ''K''?
00:17:25,332 --> 00:17:28,130
You've got to help me!
My monkey swallowed a ''K'' !
00:17:28,332 --> 00:17:29,765
Get that animal out of here!
00:17:29,972 --> 00:17:33,282
The animal hospital is across town.
He's choking!
00:17:33,492 --> 00:17:36,052
-What is it?
-Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.
00:17:38,092 --> 00:17:38,888
Excuse me.
00:17:39,332 --> 00:17:41,562
This hospital is for people!
00:17:41,772 --> 00:17:44,047
He is people!
He has a name, okay?
00:17:44,252 --> 00:17:45,810
He watches Jeopardy!...
00:17:46,012 --> 00:17:48,651
. . .he touches himself
when nobody's watching.
00:17:49,692 --> 00:17:51,125
Please have a heart.
00:17:51,332 --> 00:17:53,482
-I'll take a look at him.
-Thank you.
00:17:53,732 --> 00:17:54,721
-Michael!
-Rachel.
00:17:54,932 --> 00:17:56,650
-What?
-Monica.
00:18:11,732 --> 00:18:12,847
Urs!
00:18:13,332 --> 00:18:15,243
I've been trying to call you.
00:18:16,412 --> 00:18:17,367
Listen. . . .
00:18:17,572 --> 00:18:21,247
Don't say ''listen. '' I know that
''listen. '' I've said that ''listen. ''
00:18:22,652 --> 00:18:23,448
I'm sorry.
00:18:24,452 --> 00:18:26,363
I don't get it.
What happened?
00:18:26,612 --> 00:18:28,921
What about what
you said under the bridge?
00:18:32,852 --> 00:18:35,366
Forget about what
I said under the bridge.
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:38,644
I was talking crazy that night.
I was so drunk.
00:18:40,332 --> 00:18:41,242
You don't drink.
00:18:42,012 --> 00:18:43,843
That's right, I don't.
00:18:44,412 --> 00:18:46,243
But I was drunk on you.
00:18:48,412 --> 00:18:50,050
But it's not gonna work.
00:18:50,732 --> 00:18:53,292
Why? Is it because
I'm friends with Phoebe?
00:18:54,492 --> 00:18:57,165
If it was, would you
stop hanging out with her?
00:19:00,452 --> 00:19:02,124
No, I couldn't do that.
00:19:03,532 --> 00:19:05,443
Then, yeah, it's because of Phoebe.
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,451
So you know, it's either her or me.
00:19:12,412 --> 00:19:13,845
Then I'm sorry.
00:19:19,972 --> 00:19:22,247
You're gonna be
really hard to get over.
00:19:23,052 --> 00:19:24,041
I know.
00:19:30,012 --> 00:19:34,244
I don't know whether it's just
because we're breaking up or what. . .
00:19:34,492 --> 00:19:36,403
. . .but you've never
looked so beautiful.
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:38,041
Really?
00:20:07,652 --> 00:20:08,846
Pheebs?
00:20:19,292 --> 00:20:20,520
He looks so tiny.
00:20:22,132 --> 00:20:23,804
-We just got the message.
-Is he okay?
00:20:24,012 --> 00:20:26,242
The doctor got the ''K'' out.
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:29,082
He also found an ''M'' and an ''O. ''
00:20:30,932 --> 00:20:33,651
We think he was trying
to spell out ''monkey. ''
00:20:39,732 --> 00:20:43,042
The doctor says he'll be fine.
He's just sleeping now.
00:20:44,652 --> 00:20:46,370
So you feel like a dad yet?
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,284
No. Why?
00:20:48,652 --> 00:20:52,122
Come on, you came through.
You did what you had to do.
00:20:52,332 --> 00:20:54,050
That's very ''dad. ''
00:20:54,572 --> 00:20:55,402
He's waking up.
00:20:55,732 --> 00:20:58,087
Hey, fella.
How you doing?
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
