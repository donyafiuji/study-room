00:00:14,892 --> 00:00:16,803
Rach, we're running low on résumés.
00:00:17,452 --> 00:00:19,602
Do you want a job
with Popular Mechanics?
00:00:19,852 --> 00:00:23,288
If you must work for mechanics,
those are the ones to work for.
00:00:24,172 --> 00:00:26,322
Look, you guys.
I'm going for anything here.
00:00:26,572 --> 00:00:28,563
I can't be a waitress anymore.
I mean it.
00:00:28,772 --> 00:00:33,084
I'm sick of the lousy tips.
I'm sick of being called ''Excuse Me. ''
00:00:33,972 --> 00:00:36,088
Rach, did you proofread these?
00:00:37,172 --> 00:00:38,048
Why?
00:00:39,132 --> 00:00:43,489
Nothing. I'm sure they'll be
impressed with your ''compuper'' skills!
00:00:43,852 --> 00:00:45,570
Oh, my God!
00:00:46,732 --> 00:00:48,688
Do you think it's on all of them?
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:54,889
No, I'm sure the Xerox machine
caught a few!
00:00:56,452 --> 00:00:57,931
The One With the Poker

English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.
00:01:44,652 --> 00:01:45,767
Hey, guys.
00:01:47,372 --> 00:01:48,646
Hi, ladies.
00:01:49,372 --> 00:01:51,249
Can I get you anything?
00:01:51,452 --> 00:01:53,488
-Did you bring the mail?
-Lots of responses.
00:01:53,732 --> 00:01:56,690
Really? Sure we have scones left!
00:01:57,332 --> 00:01:58,287
Read them to me.
00:01:58,532 --> 00:02:02,844
''Dear Miss Greene: Thank you
for your inquiry. However. . . . ''
00:02:03,652 --> 00:02:06,485
-We have apple cinnamon--
-''Dear Miss Greene'' . . . .
00:02:12,452 --> 00:02:14,170
Your VISA bill is huge!
00:02:15,692 --> 00:02:16,568
Give me that.
00:02:16,972 --> 00:02:18,724
I can't believe you.
Linda's great.
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,883
-Why won't you date her?
-I don't know.
00:02:21,132 --> 00:02:22,360
Is this still about her. . .
00:02:22,572 --> 00:02:25,291
. . . ''The Flintstones could
have really happened'' thing?
00:02:26,572 --> 00:02:27,687
It's not just that.
00:02:27,892 --> 00:02:30,531
It's just, I want someone
who does something for me. . .
00:02:30,772 --> 00:02:32,569
. . .who gets my heart pounding. . .
00:02:33,492 --> 00:02:35,483
. . .who makes me. . . .
00:02:37,252 --> 00:02:39,686
Little play things with yarn?
00:02:41,092 --> 00:02:42,127
What?
00:02:42,572 --> 00:02:44,722
Could you want her more?
00:02:45,572 --> 00:02:46,368
Who?
00:02:46,732 --> 00:02:50,042
Who? Dee, the sarcastic sister
from What's Happening!
00:02:53,052 --> 00:02:53,848
Who?
00:02:57,332 --> 00:02:59,607
Look, I am totally, totally over her.
00:02:59,852 --> 00:03:01,285
-I just--
-Coffee?
00:03:01,532 --> 00:03:03,887
No, we're fine.
We're fine.
00:03:09,052 --> 00:03:09,848
Shut up!
00:03:10,052 --> 00:03:12,008
We're not saying anything.
00:03:12,252 --> 00:03:13,367
What?
00:03:13,572 --> 00:03:15,483
Joey cried last night.
00:03:15,972 --> 00:03:17,166
Thank you.
00:03:17,972 --> 00:03:19,166
We were playing poker.
00:03:19,372 --> 00:03:22,170
There was chocolate on the 3.
It looked like an 8.
00:03:23,972 --> 00:03:26,930
God, you should've seen him.
''Read them and weep! ''
00:03:27,172 --> 00:03:28,730
And then he did.
00:03:30,172 --> 00:03:33,687
Now, how come you guys
have never played poker with us?
00:03:33,932 --> 00:03:37,891
What is that? Some guy thing?
Like some kind of sexist guy thing?
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:40,811
Like it's poker,
so only guys can play?
00:03:41,052 --> 00:03:42,531
Women are welcome to play.
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:46,731
Then what is it? Some kind of, like,
some kind of, you know. . . .
00:03:46,972 --> 00:03:48,371
All right, what is it?
00:03:50,292 --> 00:03:52,362
There just aren't
any women in our game.
00:03:52,572 --> 00:03:56,247
We just don't happen to know any
women that know how to play poker.
00:03:56,452 --> 00:04:00,240
Please! That is such a lame excuse.
It's a typical guy response.
00:04:00,452 --> 00:04:01,771
Do you know how to play?
00:04:02,372 --> 00:04:03,566
No.
00:04:05,252 --> 00:04:06,480
But you could teach us.
00:04:06,732 --> 00:04:08,085
No.
00:04:12,572 --> 00:04:16,281
Okay, so now we draw cards.
00:04:19,772 --> 00:04:22,127
I wouldn't need any,
because I have a straight.
00:04:22,332 --> 00:04:24,687
-Oh, good for you!
-Congratulations!
00:04:27,492 --> 00:04:29,210
Pheebs, how many do you want?
00:04:29,892 --> 00:04:34,283
I just need two. The 1 0 of spades
and the 6 of clubs.
00:04:35,972 --> 00:04:37,485
Pheebs, you can't do that.
00:04:37,732 --> 00:04:39,450
I've got the 1 0 of spades. Here.
00:04:39,652 --> 00:04:40,562
Thanks.
00:04:42,772 --> 00:04:44,490
See, you can't do that.
00:04:44,732 --> 00:04:46,927
I don't need them.
I'm going for 4s.
00:04:47,132 --> 00:04:48,201
Oh, you're. . . .
00:04:53,892 --> 00:04:54,802
Here we go.
00:04:55,052 --> 00:04:58,089
We've got salmon roulettes
and assorted crudités.
00:04:58,732 --> 00:04:59,926
What are you doing?
00:05:00,172 --> 00:05:03,881
This is a poker game. You can't serve
food with more than one syllable.
00:05:04,092 --> 00:05:08,324
It's got to be like chips
or dip or pretz--
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,166
At this point, the dealer--
00:05:11,372 --> 00:05:14,967
We got it. Let's play for real.
High stakes! Big bucks!
00:05:15,172 --> 00:05:17,527
You sure? Phoebe
just threw away two jacks. . .
00:05:17,772 --> 00:05:19,524
. . .because they didn't look happy.
00:05:23,292 --> 00:05:26,284
But I'm ready. So just deal.
00:05:26,532 --> 00:05:29,490
Everybody, last minute
lesson! Joey. . . .
00:05:29,692 --> 00:05:30,886
Three. . .
00:05:31,172 --> 00:05:32,002
. . .eight!
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,568
Eight, three. All right!
00:05:39,492 --> 00:05:41,448
Damn it, damn it, damn it!
00:05:41,932 --> 00:05:44,082
I see. So then you were lying.
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:46,487
-About what?
-About how good your cards were.
00:05:47,172 --> 00:05:48,321
I was bluffing.
00:05:49,252 --> 00:05:51,402
And what is ''bluffing''?
00:05:53,172 --> 00:05:56,289
Is it not another word for lying?
00:05:56,772 --> 00:05:58,649
Sorry to break up this party. . .
00:05:58,852 --> 00:06:01,650
. . .but I've got résumés to fax
before work tomorrow.
00:06:01,852 --> 00:06:03,331
Rach, we've got to settle.
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:04,846
Settle what?
00:06:05,772 --> 00:06:08,081
The Jamestown colony of Virginia.
00:06:09,972 --> 00:06:12,691
You see, King George
is giving us the land, so. . . .
00:06:15,612 --> 00:06:18,570
The game, Rachel.
You owe us money for the game.
00:06:18,772 --> 00:06:19,568
Oh, right!
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:23,248
Guys, it's their first time.
Why don't we forget about the money?
00:06:23,452 --> 00:06:25,727
Hell, no! We'll pay.
00:06:25,972 --> 00:06:29,487
Okay, Monica, I had
another answer all ready.
00:06:30,652 --> 00:06:31,687
And you know what?
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,486
-We want a rematch.
-That's fine with me.
00:06:34,692 --> 00:06:36,091
Could use the money.
00:06:37,532 --> 00:06:41,571
So you get your ya-yas
by taking money from your friends.
00:06:43,172 --> 00:06:45,766
And I get my ya-yas from Ikea.
00:06:47,772 --> 00:06:50,969
You have to put them together
yourself, but they cost less.
00:06:52,252 --> 00:06:54,891
Look, Rachel, this is poker.
I play to win.
00:06:55,132 --> 00:06:57,487
In order for me to win,
others have to lose.
00:06:57,692 --> 00:07:01,128
If you're gonna play poker with me,
don't expect me to be nice.
00:07:01,372 --> 00:07:04,284
Because once those cards
are dealt. . . .
00:07:17,572 --> 00:07:19,688
I'm not a nice guy.
00:07:26,092 --> 00:07:27,684
All right, boys. Let's eat.
00:07:27,892 --> 00:07:31,282
Did you get that from
the ''I Love Rachel'' pizzeria?
00:07:32,012 --> 00:07:32,922
Are you still on that?
00:07:33,132 --> 00:07:35,692
Come on. What was with that
Black Bart speech?
00:07:35,932 --> 00:07:39,083
''When I play poker,
I'm not a nice guy'' !
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,166
You're way off, pal.
00:07:41,372 --> 00:07:44,842
I don't think so. See, Ross,
because I think you love her!
00:07:46,772 --> 00:07:50,082
I might have had feelings for her
at one time. Not anymore.
00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:52,852
I just-- Marcel!
00:07:53,052 --> 00:07:54,610
Where are you going
with that disk?
00:07:54,852 --> 00:07:57,286
You are not putting that on again.
00:07:57,492 --> 00:08:01,246
If you press that button,
you are in very, very big trouble.
00:08:14,852 --> 00:08:17,446
You believe what a jerk
Ross was being?
00:08:17,652 --> 00:08:18,448
Yeah, I know.
00:08:18,652 --> 00:08:20,688
He can get really competitive.
00:08:23,372 --> 00:08:24,407
What?
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:28,284
''Hello, Kettle, this is Monica.
You're black! ''
00:08:28,532 --> 00:08:29,885
Please!
00:08:32,772 --> 00:08:34,922
I am not as bad as Ross.
00:08:35,132 --> 00:08:38,920
I beg to differ.
The Pictionary incident?
00:08:39,132 --> 00:08:40,531
That was not an incident.
00:08:40,772 --> 00:08:45,084
I was gesturing and the plate
slipped out of my hand.
00:08:48,852 --> 00:08:52,162
-I got an interview!
-You're kidding! Where?
00:08:52,412 --> 00:08:55,688
Saks Fifth Avenue!
00:08:56,972 --> 00:09:00,282
It's like the mother ship
is calling you home.
00:09:03,932 --> 00:09:05,001
What's the job?
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,089
Assistant buyer!
00:09:08,332 --> 00:09:10,288
I would be shopping. . .
00:09:11,692 --> 00:09:13,489
. . .for a living!
00:09:15,372 --> 00:09:19,081
That's Aunt Iris. This woman's been
playing poker since she was 5.
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,647
You've got to listen
to every word she says.
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:25,365
-Is Tony Randall dead?
-I don't think so.
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:27,603
He may be now.
I think I hit him with my car.
00:09:28,732 --> 00:09:31,610
-My God! Really?
-No, that's bluffing! Lesson one!
00:09:34,052 --> 00:09:35,485
Let me tell you something.
00:09:35,692 --> 00:09:38,525
Everything you hear
at a poker game is pure crap!
00:09:39,492 --> 00:09:41,483
-Nice earrings.
-Thank you.
00:09:44,092 --> 00:09:46,083
Girls, sit down!
00:09:46,332 --> 00:09:48,607
Aunt Iris, this is Phoebe,
and that's Rachel--
00:09:48,852 --> 00:09:52,128
Listen, I am parked at a meter.
Let's do it.
00:10:00,812 --> 00:10:04,043
Ross, could we please, please,
listen to anything else?
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:05,691
All right.
00:10:21,332 --> 00:10:23,368
I'm gonna pay for that tonight.
00:10:29,452 --> 00:10:31,010
Guys, guess what, guess what?
00:10:32,572 --> 00:10:35,803
The fifth dentist caved, and now
they all recommend Trident?
00:10:41,652 --> 00:10:43,847
No, the interview!
00:10:44,092 --> 00:10:45,684
She loved me.
She absolutely loved me.
00:10:45,932 --> 00:10:49,607
We talked for two and a half hours.
We have the same taste in clothes.
00:10:50,332 --> 00:10:52,084
And I went to camp with her cousin.
00:10:52,332 --> 00:10:55,324
And the job is perfect!
I can do this well!
00:10:55,532 --> 00:10:56,601
That's great!
00:10:56,852 --> 00:10:58,922
God! And she told
the funniest story.
00:10:59,172 --> 00:11:01,049
Great, you'll tell us
and we'll laugh!
00:11:01,252 --> 00:11:02,446
Let's play poker!
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,010
Listen, we talked about it. . .
00:11:06,212 --> 00:11:09,284
. . .and if you don't want to play,
we completely understand.
00:11:09,532 --> 00:11:11,682
We can play some other game. Like. . .
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:13,047
. . .Pictionary?
00:11:15,292 --> 00:11:16,520
Very funny.
00:11:16,772 --> 00:11:19,047
We'd give poker another try.
Shall we, ladies?
00:11:19,252 --> 00:11:20,685
Yes, I think we should.
00:11:21,172 --> 00:11:22,890
Rach, do you want me
to shuffle those?
00:11:23,132 --> 00:11:25,692
That's okay,
I'm gonna give it a go.
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:40,325
So Pheebs owes 7.50.
Monica, you owe $ 1 0.00.
00:11:40,572 --> 00:11:43,484
And, Rachel, you owe 1 5 big ones!
00:11:44,652 --> 00:11:48,361
Thanks for teaching us ''Crossed-eyed
Mary. '' We gotta play that other way.
00:11:50,172 --> 00:11:53,960
Here's my 7.50, but you should
know that this money is cursed.
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,083
-What?
-I cursed it!
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,731
So now bad things will happen
to he who spends it.
00:12:01,412 --> 00:12:04,290
I'll take it.
Bad things happen to me anyway.
00:12:05,452 --> 00:12:07,807
This way, I can break them up
with a movie.
00:12:08,052 --> 00:12:12,967
So that just leaves the big
Greene poker machine, who owes 1 5.
00:12:14,092 --> 00:12:15,491
It's so typical:
00:12:15,732 --> 00:12:18,087
''I'm a man! I have a penis!
00:12:18,292 --> 00:12:21,887
I have to win money
to exert my power over women! ''
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:26,771
You know, this isn't over.
00:12:27,052 --> 00:12:30,044
We will play you again.
And we will win and you will lose.
00:12:30,252 --> 00:12:31,844
And you will beg and we will laugh.
00:12:32,132 --> 00:12:33,724
And we will take
every last dime you have.
00:12:33,972 --> 00:12:36,486
And you will
hate yourselves forever!
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:41,891
Kind of stepped on
my point there, Monica!
00:12:47,492 --> 00:12:49,289
Wanna hand over your money now?
00:12:49,532 --> 00:12:52,649
That way, we don't have to go
through the formality of playing.
00:12:53,452 --> 00:12:57,570
No, that's fine. We'll see
who has the last laugh, monkey boy.
00:13:00,372 --> 00:13:03,330
Are we done with the chit chat?
Ready for serious poker?
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:07,081
You guys, look! The one-eyed Jack
follows me wherever I go.
00:13:08,652 --> 00:13:10,529
Right, okay. Serious poker.
00:13:11,772 --> 00:13:13,728
Excuse me.
Where are you going?
00:13:13,932 --> 00:13:14,808
To the bathroom.
00:13:15,332 --> 00:13:17,641
Do you wanna go to the bathroom
or play poker?
00:13:17,932 --> 00:13:19,445
I wanna go to the bathroom.
00:13:21,652 --> 00:13:23,882
Well, I'm gonna order a pizza.
00:13:24,452 --> 00:13:28,365
I'm waiting to hear from that job. The
store closes at 9. You can eat then.
00:13:29,172 --> 00:13:33,085
That's fine. I'll just have
a Tic Tac to hold me over.
00:13:34,532 --> 00:13:38,161
Cincinnati. No blinds.
Everybody ante.
00:13:38,532 --> 00:13:39,328
Yes!
00:13:40,572 --> 00:13:41,891
Or no!
00:13:45,652 --> 00:13:47,210
Your money's mine, Greene.
00:13:47,412 --> 00:13:49,004
Your fly's open, Geller.
00:13:54,732 --> 00:13:56,370
You know what I just realized?
00:13:57,372 --> 00:14:00,409
''Joker'' is ''poker'' with a ''J'' !
00:14:02,732 --> 00:14:04,131
Coincidence?
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:09,080
That's ''joincidence'' with a ''C'' !
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:22,290
Yeah, I'm out.
00:14:23,252 --> 00:14:24,401
I'm in.
00:14:24,772 --> 00:14:25,727
Me too.
00:14:25,972 --> 00:14:27,690
Me too.
What do you got?
00:14:28,572 --> 00:14:32,929
You better hop out of the shower,
because I got a flush.
00:14:35,732 --> 00:14:37,290
Well, well, well!
00:14:37,532 --> 00:14:42,083
Hop back in, bucko,
because I got four 6s!
00:14:42,292 --> 00:14:45,125
I got four 6s!
I won! I actually won!
00:14:45,412 --> 00:14:46,208
Oh, my God!
00:14:46,412 --> 00:14:49,370
You know what?
I'm gonna make a little Ross pile.
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:55,483
I think that one was Ross' .
And I think that one was Ross' .
00:14:56,932 --> 00:15:00,641
Well, I have got your money
And you'll never see it
00:15:00,852 --> 00:15:03,002
And your fly's still open
00:15:03,212 --> 00:15:05,089
I made you look
00:15:07,892 --> 00:15:10,326
-I'm in.
-I couldn't be inner.
00:15:10,572 --> 00:15:13,040
Monica, in or out?
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,084
I hate this game!
00:15:23,012 --> 00:15:24,411
Okay, Joey, your bet.
00:15:24,612 --> 00:15:27,729
I fold, like a cheap hooker
who got hit in the stomach. . .
00:15:27,972 --> 00:15:30,725
. . .by a fat guy
with sores on his face.
00:15:34,172 --> 00:15:35,321
I'm out.
00:15:37,572 --> 00:15:39,483
I'm very in.
00:15:41,532 --> 00:15:42,567
Couldn't be more out.
00:15:42,772 --> 00:15:43,682
Me too.
00:15:45,732 --> 00:15:49,327
I will see you and I'll raise you.
00:15:49,852 --> 00:15:51,649
Do you wanna waste another buck?
00:15:52,572 --> 00:15:53,891
No, not this time.
00:15:54,572 --> 00:15:56,403
-What did you have?
-I'm not telling.
00:15:56,612 --> 00:15:57,727
Come on, show them.
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:01,525
-Get your hands out of there!
-I've had dates like this.
00:16:04,732 --> 00:16:07,690
Boy, you really can't stand
to lose, can you?
00:16:07,932 --> 00:16:08,887
Your whole face is getting red.
00:16:09,132 --> 00:16:12,488
Little veins popping out
of your temple.
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:16,369
Plus that shirt doesn't really
match those pants.
00:16:20,092 --> 00:16:23,687
-I'm not losing. Just deal the--
-You are definitely losing.
00:16:23,932 --> 00:16:24,967
Rachel Greene.
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:28,007
Excuse me.
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:29,964
It's about the job!
00:16:30,492 --> 00:16:32,767
Barbara, hi! How are you?
00:16:37,252 --> 00:16:38,571
No, I understand.
00:16:40,972 --> 00:16:44,282
Come on. No, I'm fine.
Don't be silly.
00:16:45,132 --> 00:16:48,807
But, you know, if anything else
opens up, please--
00:17:07,972 --> 00:17:09,087
Sorry, Rach.
00:17:09,492 --> 00:17:11,926
You know, there's gonna be
lots of other stuff.
00:17:14,932 --> 00:17:16,285
Where were we?
00:17:17,532 --> 00:17:21,445
Five card draw. Jacks are better.
00:17:21,652 --> 00:17:23,051
Nothing wild, everybody ante.
00:17:23,852 --> 00:17:25,888
Look, Rach,
we don't have to do this.
00:17:26,652 --> 00:17:28,085
Yes, we do.
00:17:30,692 --> 00:17:32,648
-All right. Check.
-Check.
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,326
I'm in for 50 cents.
00:17:35,052 --> 00:17:37,282
-Call.
-I'm in.
00:17:38,172 --> 00:17:40,732
I see your 50 cents. . .
00:17:40,972 --> 00:17:42,883
. . .and I raise you. . .
00:17:43,492 --> 00:17:44,368
. . . $5.
00:17:45,172 --> 00:17:47,402
I thought it was a 50-cent limit.
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:50,411
I just lost a job, and
I'd like to raise the bet $5.
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,688
Does anybody
have a problem with that?
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,688
-Not at all.
-No, no.
00:17:59,572 --> 00:18:00,721
Loser?
00:18:08,532 --> 00:18:09,601
No, I fold.
00:18:09,932 --> 00:18:12,287
What do you mean, you ''fold''?
What is this?
00:18:12,532 --> 00:18:16,730
I thought that, ''Once the cards
are dealt, I'm not a nice guy! ''
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:18,405
Were you just full of it?
00:18:32,092 --> 00:18:33,081
I'm in.
00:18:33,932 --> 00:18:35,968
-How many do you want?
-One.
00:18:37,452 --> 00:18:39,090
Dealer takes two.
00:18:39,692 --> 00:18:42,411
-What do you bet?
-I bet $2.
00:18:44,852 --> 00:18:46,285
See your 2. . .
00:18:46,972 --> 00:18:49,088
. . .and I raise you. . .
00:18:50,572 --> 00:18:51,368
. . .20.
00:18:57,092 --> 00:18:57,922
I see your 20. . .
00:18:59,892 --> 00:19:00,768
. . .raise you 25.
00:19:07,052 --> 00:19:08,883
See your 25. . .
00:19:09,372 --> 00:19:11,010
. . .and, Monica, get my purse.
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,925
There's nothing in it.
00:19:20,052 --> 00:19:22,282
Okay, then get me your purse.
00:19:27,252 --> 00:19:28,765
Here you go. Good luck!
00:19:28,972 --> 00:19:29,961
Thank you.
00:19:30,452 --> 00:19:33,922
I saw your 25 and I raise you. . .
00:19:34,452 --> 00:19:35,248
. . .seven.
00:19:36,972 --> 00:19:37,927
--teen!
00:19:46,092 --> 00:19:47,730
Joey, I'm a little shy.
00:19:48,892 --> 00:19:51,486
That's okay, Ross. You can ask me.
00:19:57,652 --> 00:19:59,483
-What do you need?
-Fifteen.
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:01,529
-Here's 1 0.
-I got 5.
00:20:01,772 --> 00:20:03,763
-Thank you.
-Good luck.
00:20:04,732 --> 00:20:07,326
I am calling your 1 7.
00:20:07,572 --> 00:20:09,130
What do you got?
00:20:19,492 --> 00:20:20,686
Full house!
00:20:29,492 --> 00:20:30,891
You got me.
00:20:41,252 --> 00:20:43,971
-That's a tough hand to beat.
-I thought we had them!
00:20:44,172 --> 00:20:47,847
When you don't have the cards,
you don't have the cards.
00:20:48,052 --> 00:20:49,929
But look how happy she is.
00:21:00,852 --> 00:21:01,762
-Airmail.
-Airplane.
00:21:01,972 --> 00:21:03,690
Airport.
Airport '7 5!
00:21:03,932 --> 00:21:06,844
Airport '7 7! Airport '79!
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:08,567
Time's up.
00:21:09,172 --> 00:21:11,811
Bye Bye Birdie!
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:15,085
That's a bird?
00:21:15,812 --> 00:21:17,291
That's a bird!
00:21:18,732 --> 00:21:20,484
Okay, it's my turn.
00:21:22,492 --> 00:21:23,527
Go!
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:27,929
Bean! Bean!
00:21:29,732 --> 00:21:32,087
The Unbearable Lightness of Being!
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,765
That you get?
00:21:36,972 --> 00:21:39,088
That you get?
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
