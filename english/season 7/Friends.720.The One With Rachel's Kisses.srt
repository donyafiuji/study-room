00:00:06,252 --> 00:00:10,450  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:446 Y2:524
Out of all of us, who do you think
will get married next?
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,480  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:484 Y2:524
Probably Monica and Chandler.
00:00:16,572 --> 00:00:19,086  X1:086 X2:631 Y1:484 Y2:524
Could I have a pack of Newport Lights?
00:00:19,292 --> 00:00:23,080  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:444 Y2:524
We don't sell cigarettes,
but they do across the street.
00:00:23,292 --> 00:00:25,806  X1:176 X2:538 Y1:482 Y2:524
That'd be great. Thanks.
00:00:27,492 --> 00:00:31,405  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:444 Y2:524
Melissa Worbert. I don't think
I have the energy for this.
00:00:32,852 --> 00:00:36,162  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God! Ray-Ray Greene?
00:00:40,732 --> 00:00:43,963  X1:144 X2:570 Y1:444 Y2:524
You've been MIA
for seven sorority newsletters.
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:46,248  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:482 Y2:524
What's up with you?
00:00:46,452 --> 00:00:48,886  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:482 Y2:524
Why don't I tell you over here?
00:00:49,772 --> 00:00:54,129  X1:155 X2:559 Y1:446 Y2:524
So last I heard
you were gonna get married.
00:00:54,372 --> 00:00:55,964  X1:252 X2:463 Y1:484 Y2:524
Poor Ray-Ray.
00:00:56,572 --> 00:00:58,688  X1:203 X2:513 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, no. It's all good.
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,645  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:446 Y2:524
- I actually work at Ralph Lauren.
- Shut up!
00:01:01,852 --> 00:01:05,731  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:524
I will not. I'm the divisional head
of men's sportswear.
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:09,447  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:446 Y2:524
Shut up more!
Are you friends with Ralph?
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,961  X1:265 X2:450 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Oh, please.
- Are you?
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:13,685  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
No.
00:01:14,332 --> 00:01:17,722  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:446 Y2:524
We have to have dinner.
What are you doing tomorrow?
00:01:17,932 --> 00:01:21,447  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Tomorrow. I don't know.
- You're having dinner with me.
00:01:22,212 --> 00:01:23,804  X1:287 X2:427 Y1:484 Y2:524
Shut up.
00:01:24,012 --> 00:01:27,084  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:444 Y2:524
I've gotta go.
This has been so great.
00:01:27,292 --> 00:01:29,681  X1:225 X2:491 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, there you are.
00:01:29,892 --> 00:01:32,964  X1:197 X2:517 Y1:446 Y2:524
So listen, just call me.
Here's my card.
00:01:33,172 --> 00:01:36,323  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:448 Y2:524
- You're in real estate?
- No, that's an old card.
00:01:36,572 --> 00:01:39,928  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:450 Y2:524
I got out of that to do something
where I could...
00:01:40,172 --> 00:01:42,686  X1:101 X2:615 Y1:484 Y2:524
...help people and make a difference.
00:01:42,892 --> 00:01:44,405  X1:199 X2:517 Y1:484 Y2:524
What do you do now?
00:01:44,932 --> 00:01:47,287  X1:216 X2:500 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm a party planner.
00:01:47,532 --> 00:01:50,046  X1:196 X2:520 Y1:444 Y2:524
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.
00:01:51,052 --> 00:01:54,089  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:524
Look who's back. It's Ray-Ray.
00:01:55,092 --> 00:01:57,970  X1:154 X2:561 Y1:446 Y2:524
That was my friend, Melissa,
from college.
00:01:58,172 --> 00:02:00,891  X1:158 X2:556 Y1:484 Y2:524
She seems really, really fun!
00:02:01,692 --> 00:02:05,128  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:444 Y2:524
She's actually sweet,
and we used to be very close.
00:02:05,332 --> 00:02:09,291  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:446 Y2:524
Wait a minute.
She's not the one who you...?
00:02:09,532 --> 00:02:12,285  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:484 Y2:524
Who you what? Who you what?
00:02:13,252 --> 00:02:15,129  X1:301 X2:414 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Yes.
- Wow!
00:02:15,372 --> 00:02:17,840  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:484 Y2:524
Wow, what? Who you what?
00:02:18,052 --> 00:02:20,202  X1:196 X2:519 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, it's not a big deal.
00:02:20,412 --> 00:02:21,561  X1:227 X2:488 Y1:484 Y2:524
They were lovers.
00:02:21,772 --> 00:02:23,364  X1:298 X2:419 Y1:450 Y2:524
- What?
- What?
00:02:23,572 --> 00:02:25,483  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, we weren't. It was nothing.
00:02:25,732 --> 00:02:29,281  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:446 Y2:524
It was one night, senior year,
and we went to a party...
00:02:29,492 --> 00:02:33,690  X1:166 X2:548 Y1:446 Y2:524
...had a lot of sangria,
and you know, ended up...
00:02:33,932 --> 00:02:35,445  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:484 Y2:524
...kissing for a bit.
00:02:35,652 --> 00:02:38,724  X1:165 X2:549 Y1:482 Y2:524
So that's two of my wives.
00:02:40,212 --> 00:02:42,282  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:524
The One With Rachel's Kisses
00:02:44,812 --> 00:02:45,801  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:446 Y2:524
English Subtitles by
SDI Media Group
00:03:20,372 --> 00:03:23,682  X1:155 X2:559 Y1:052 Y2:126
So this is where the band is.
And here's the bar.
00:03:23,932 --> 00:03:28,881  X1:085 X2:632 Y1:052 Y2:132
And all these pins have people's names
on them. Rach, here you are.
00:03:30,092 --> 00:03:33,562  X1:137 X2:577 Y1:444 Y2:524
Why don't we just put me
with a Manhattan in my hand...
00:03:33,772 --> 00:03:36,650  X1:139 X2:577 Y1:484 Y2:524
...talking to the cute bartender.
00:03:39,532 --> 00:03:42,285  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:524
These pins aren't for playing,
are they?
00:03:42,532 --> 00:03:45,410  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:446 Y2:524
The red are my guests,
and the blue are yours.
00:03:45,612 --> 00:03:48,331  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:052 Y2:131
This is so sad.
I only have like 10 pins.
00:03:48,572 --> 00:03:51,325  X1:114 X2:602 Y1:052 Y2:091
Chandler, relax. It's not a contest.
00:03:51,572 --> 00:03:53,688  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:052 Y2:093
Certainly not a close one.
00:04:00,292 --> 00:04:01,884  X1:273 X2:443 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, Rach.
00:04:03,812 --> 00:04:06,087  X1:233 X2:481 Y1:052 Y2:093
Stop picturing it!
00:04:08,532 --> 00:04:13,083  X1:119 X2:600 Y1:052 Y2:132
I think that's it. The seating chart
is done. This is our wedding.
00:04:13,292 --> 00:04:15,965  X1:104 X2:610 Y1:052 Y2:094
They all look like they're having fun.
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:19,130  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:052 Y2:093
So where are my parents gonna be?
00:04:19,372 --> 00:04:22,284  X1:125 X2:589 Y1:052 Y2:093
Well, if this is the wedding hall...
00:04:22,532 --> 00:04:26,241  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:450 Y2:524
...your parents would be over here
at home in Queens.
00:04:26,452 --> 00:04:30,411  X1:119 X2:597 Y1:052 Y2:132
They're not invited?
Oh, no, they're gonna be crushed!
00:04:30,612 --> 00:04:33,126  X1:095 X2:622 Y1:052 Y2:094
Why would they think they're invited?
00:04:33,372 --> 00:04:35,647  X1:190 X2:524 Y1:052 Y2:094
You got me. I don't... .
00:04:35,852 --> 00:04:38,889  X1:093 X2:622 Y1:052 Y2:131
- Joey!
- Look, I thought parents were coming.
00:04:39,092 --> 00:04:42,004  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:052 Y2:131
Your parents are coming.
Chandler's are coming.
00:04:42,252 --> 00:04:44,527  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:052 Y2:094
Ross' parents are coming.
00:04:44,732 --> 00:04:48,202  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:482 Y2:524
Ross' parents are my parents.
00:04:48,692 --> 00:04:51,081  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:484 Y2:524
Well, see, parents are coming.
00:04:51,732 --> 00:04:55,281  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:446 Y2:524
- We should invite them.
- You just want more blue pins.
00:04:55,492 --> 00:04:57,881  X1:205 X2:509 Y1:484 Y2:524
Well, this is just sad.
00:04:58,692 --> 00:05:03,129  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:446 Y2:524
All right. Maybe I can fit them in
if I just do some rearranging.
00:05:03,332 --> 00:05:05,687  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:484 Y2:524
Rachel may have to sit at the bar.
00:05:05,892 --> 00:05:08,326  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:484 Y2:524
That is not a problem.
00:05:08,532 --> 00:05:12,491  X1:116 X2:600 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Maybe you'll order a little sangria.
- Get out of here!
00:05:16,332 --> 00:05:20,723  X1:118 X2:598 Y1:446 Y2:524
These are our tuxedos. If you like
anything, we can make a deal.
00:05:20,932 --> 00:05:25,403  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:446 Y2:524
Anything at all. But these are
the three that Monica pre-approved.
00:05:26,372 --> 00:05:28,488  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:484 Y2:524
Thanks a lot for hooking me up.
00:05:28,732 --> 00:05:33,567  X1:081 X2:633 Y1:446 Y2:524
And I want you to know that I want
you to attend our wedding as my guest.
00:05:35,372 --> 00:05:38,284  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:488 Y2:524
I'm Monica's maid of honor.
00:05:38,492 --> 00:05:41,370  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, don't try to blue-pin me.
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:45,204  X1:198 X2:518 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Well, these look nice.
- They are nice.
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:49,803  X1:099 X2:616 Y1:446 Y2:524
When celebrities are done with them,
they send them back.
00:05:50,012 --> 00:05:52,890  X1:127 X2:591 Y1:450 Y2:524
- You mean like for award shows?
- Some of them.
00:05:53,092 --> 00:05:56,368  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:444 Y2:524
They've been down the red carpet
with people yelling...
00:05:56,612 --> 00:05:59,490  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:450 Y2:524
..."Who are you wearing?
You look fabulous! "
00:05:59,732 --> 00:06:02,929  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:450 Y2:524
Might I suggest watching
a little more ESPN...
00:06:03,172 --> 00:06:05,288  X1:208 X2:508 Y1:488 Y2:524
...and a little less E! .
00:06:06,452 --> 00:06:08,443  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay. Who wore those?
00:06:09,372 --> 00:06:13,285  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Well, this one's Tom Brokaw.
- Not bad.
00:06:13,492 --> 00:06:16,484  X1:191 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:524
This one is Paul O'Neil.
00:06:16,732 --> 00:06:19,087  X1:264 X2:452 Y1:488 Y2:524
Who's that?
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:23,171  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:446 Y2:524
He plays for the Yankees.
Seriously, ESPN.
00:06:23,412 --> 00:06:26,961  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:446 Y2:524
Just once in a while.
Have it on in the background.
00:06:29,252 --> 00:06:32,528  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:450 Y2:524
- This one was Pierce Brosnan.
- Pierce Brosnan?
00:06:32,772 --> 00:06:33,887  X1:234 X2:482 Y1:484 Y2:524
Are you serious?
00:06:34,132 --> 00:06:34,962  X1:311 X2:406 Y1:488 Y2:524
007?
00:06:35,212 --> 00:06:40,286  X1:105 X2:611 Y1:444 Y2:524
This is James Bond's tux? I have to
get married in James Bond's tux.
00:06:40,492 --> 00:06:42,005  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's a pretty cool tux.
00:06:42,252 --> 00:06:46,768  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's not just that. I would be
England's most powerful weapon.
00:06:46,972 --> 00:06:50,931  X1:133 X2:581 Y1:446 Y2:524
A jet-setting heartbreaker
on Her Majesty's secret service.
00:06:51,172 --> 00:06:54,881  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:450 Y2:524
A man who fears no one,
with a license to kill.
00:06:56,732 --> 00:06:59,292  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:524
Would Monica let me wear this?
00:07:03,332 --> 00:07:06,529  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:446 Y2:524
We should really learn
how to play the real way.
00:07:06,772 --> 00:07:08,888  X1:251 X2:465 Y1:484 Y2:524
I like our way.
00:07:10,092 --> 00:07:12,083  X1:300 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:524
Chess!
00:07:14,132 --> 00:07:15,963  X1:267 X2:449 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Nice move.
- Yeah.
00:07:18,932 --> 00:07:22,766  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:446 Y2:524
I hooked Ross and Chandler up
with tuxedos. Do you need one?
00:07:22,972 --> 00:07:25,042  X1:171 X2:544 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, I'm not wearing a tux.
00:07:25,252 --> 00:07:28,881  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:450 Y2:524
- What are you gonna wear?
- Multi-colored robes.
00:07:29,092 --> 00:07:30,844  X1:227 X2:487 Y1:484 Y2:524
And maybe a hat.
00:07:31,092 --> 00:07:33,162  X1:139 X2:579 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Does Monica know about this?
- No.
00:07:33,372 --> 00:07:35,966  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:446 Y2:524
Can I please be there
when you tell her?
00:07:38,092 --> 00:07:40,208  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:484 Y2:524
You want to go to a movie tonight?
00:07:40,452 --> 00:07:42,761  X1:140 X2:575 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm having dinner with Melissa.
00:07:42,972 --> 00:07:44,690  X1:264 X2:454 Y1:488 Y2:524
Can I come?
00:07:45,772 --> 00:07:48,764  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:444 Y2:524
I won't talk.
You'll just hear my video camera.
00:07:48,972 --> 00:07:51,770  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:450 Y2:524
- What? What's going on?
- Can I tell her?
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:55,362  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:446 Y2:524
Do you want what happened,
or Joey's lewd version?
00:07:55,572 --> 00:07:56,721  X1:295 X2:419 Y1:482 Y2:524
Joey's.
00:07:58,172 --> 00:07:59,810  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:484 Y2:524
I had this college friend...
00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:03,806  X1:144 X2:570 Y1:446 Y2:524
...and I made the mistake
of telling Joey that one time...
00:08:04,052 --> 00:08:07,886  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:450 Y2:524
...she and l, you know,
kissed a little bit.
00:08:08,132 --> 00:08:11,602  X1:145 X2:569 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yeah, I'm sure that happened.
00:08:11,852 --> 00:08:14,844  X1:301 X2:415 Y1:450 Y2:524
- It did.
- Sure.
00:08:16,892 --> 00:08:19,884  X1:223 X2:492 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey. It happened.
00:08:21,092 --> 00:08:24,801  X1:126 X2:589 Y1:446 Y2:524
It was senior year.
It was after the Sigma Chi luau...
00:08:25,052 --> 00:08:27,327  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and Melissa and I got very drunk.
00:08:27,572 --> 00:08:31,451  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:450 Y2:524
And we ended up kissing.
For several minutes.
00:08:31,652 --> 00:08:35,884  X1:081 X2:636 Y1:446 Y2:524
Which means she had a couple spritzers
and a peck on the cheek.
00:08:36,492 --> 00:08:39,131  X1:083 X2:633 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why are you taking this away from me?
00:08:39,772 --> 00:08:42,002  X1:105 X2:611 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why is it so hard for you to believe?
00:08:42,212 --> 00:08:46,285  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:444 Y2:524
Okay. I just didn't know
that you were a lesbian.
00:08:51,892 --> 00:08:56,920  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian.
I'm just saying that this happened.
00:08:57,132 --> 00:09:01,410  X1:182 X2:534 Y1:446 Y2:524
It just seems pretty wild.
And you're so...
00:09:01,652 --> 00:09:02,607  X1:284 X2:432 Y1:488 Y2:524
...vanilla.
00:09:03,852 --> 00:09:08,482  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:444 Y2:524
Vanilla? I'm not vanilla.
I do lots of crazy things.
00:09:08,692 --> 00:09:11,445  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:446 Y2:524
I mean, I got drunk
and married in Vegas.
00:09:12,012 --> 00:09:14,162  X1:286 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:524
To Ross.
00:09:14,732 --> 00:09:16,484  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:482 Y2:524
If you don't believe me...
00:09:16,732 --> 00:09:20,520  X1:097 X2:623 Y1:446 Y2:524
...just come with me to dinner tonight
and she'll tell you.
00:09:20,732 --> 00:09:22,882  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay. Because I can't picture it.
00:09:23,132 --> 00:09:25,885  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:484 Y2:524
You should get inside my head.
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,682  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:484 Y2:524
Guess what I got for your wedding?
00:09:33,932 --> 00:09:36,890  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:446 Y2:524
A freakishly thin date
with a hanger for a head?
00:09:37,092 --> 00:09:40,767  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:446 Y2:524
Rachel hooked me up with a tux.
But not just any tux.
00:09:40,972 --> 00:09:42,769  X1:254 X2:462 Y1:488 Y2:524
Batman's tux!
00:09:43,412 --> 00:09:44,731  X1:259 X2:457 Y1:446 Y2:524
- What?
- That's right.
00:09:44,972 --> 00:09:49,682  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:446 Y2:524
Made expressly for Val Kilmer,
and worn by him in the hit film...
00:09:49,932 --> 00:09:52,287  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:488 Y2:524
...that Batman film he was in.
00:09:53,052 --> 00:09:56,840  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:444 Y2:524
You can't wear that.
I'm wearing the famous tux.
00:09:57,052 --> 00:10:00,601  X1:164 X2:551 Y1:446 Y2:524
If you wear that,
it'll make mine less special.
00:10:00,812 --> 00:10:03,087  X1:193 X2:524 Y1:446 Y2:524
You need something to
to make it special?
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:05,886  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:446 Y2:524
You have
the most special thing of all.
00:10:06,132 --> 00:10:09,169  X1:090 X2:624 Y1:484 Y2:524
You are marrying the woman you love.
00:10:13,132 --> 00:10:16,090  X1:139 X2:577 Y1:444 Y2:524
Don't take away my cool thing.
Pretty please?
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:20,325  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:482 Y2:524
"Pretty please?" Not very 007.
00:10:20,532 --> 00:10:24,525  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:446 Y2:524
If you were getting married,
I'd never do anything to upset you.
00:10:24,732 --> 00:10:29,123  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:446 Y2:524
- You slept with my sister.
- That was pretty 007.
00:10:33,772 --> 00:10:35,888  X1:183 X2:531 Y1:484 Y2:524
All right, I figured it out.
00:10:36,092 --> 00:10:38,890  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm gonna take 2 tables of 8,
add your parents...
00:10:39,092 --> 00:10:41,287  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:488 Y2:524
...and make them into 3 tables of 6.
00:10:41,492 --> 00:10:44,325  X1:185 X2:529 Y1:446 Y2:524
And I called the caterer.
We are good to go!
00:10:44,532 --> 00:10:47,046  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yeah. They're not coming.
00:10:48,572 --> 00:10:49,402  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?
00:10:49,652 --> 00:10:53,088  X1:158 X2:556 Y1:450 Y2:524
They think that you only
invited them because of me.
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:54,884  X1:210 X2:505 Y1:484 Y2:524
They feel unwanted.
00:10:55,092 --> 00:10:58,801  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:450 Y2:524
That's too bad.
It's true. But too bad.
00:10:59,052 --> 00:11:01,486  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:484 Y2:524
If you could just call my mom.
00:11:01,732 --> 00:11:04,292  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:446 Y2:524
Just let her know
you want them there.
00:11:04,492 --> 00:11:07,768  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:446 Y2:524
This is a woman
who has sent you many lasagnas.
00:11:07,972 --> 00:11:08,882  X1:244 X2:472 Y1:486 Y2:524
No, she hasn't.
00:11:09,092 --> 00:11:11,811  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:446 Y2:524
Is it her fault
if some didn't make it to you?
00:11:12,012 --> 00:11:13,491  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:484 Y2:524
What am I gonna say?
00:11:13,732 --> 00:11:18,123  X1:114 X2:600 Y1:446 Y2:524
Tell them you mixed up invitations.
No, blame it on the post office.
00:11:18,372 --> 00:11:21,967  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:450 Y2:524
They hate the post office.
And the Irish.
00:11:22,212 --> 00:11:25,284  X1:160 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:524
But I don't think
you could blame it on them.
00:11:27,572 --> 00:11:32,088  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:450 Y2:524
Hello? Yeah, hi. Mrs. Tribbianni?
This is Monica Geller.
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:36,763  X1:125 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm just calling to say that I really
hope you can make the wedding.
00:11:37,012 --> 00:11:40,766  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:450 Y2:524
Apparently some of our invitations
weren't delivered.
00:11:41,012 --> 00:11:45,369  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:446 Y2:524
I guess there was some screw-up
at the damn post office.
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:48,005  X1:236 X2:478 Y1:488 Y2:524
Tell me about it!
00:11:48,252 --> 00:11:53,246  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:450 Y2:524
Yeah, the U.S. Post Office?
No. More like U.S. Lost Office.
00:11:53,772 --> 00:11:56,366  X1:207 X2:510 Y1:484 Y2:524
What are they, Irish?
00:12:01,812 --> 00:12:06,681  X1:089 X2:628 Y1:444 Y2:524
Anyway, his name's Allen. And we've
been going out for three years.
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,964  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:446 Y2:524
He was my first client
when I became a party planner.
00:12:10,212 --> 00:12:14,171  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:446 Y2:524
He was actually planning a party
for his girlfriend at the time.
00:12:14,412 --> 00:12:16,289  X1:285 X2:430 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, well.
00:12:16,852 --> 00:12:22,006  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:446 Y2:524
- He was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.
- That's great.
00:12:22,252 --> 00:12:24,925  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Were you ever in a sorority?
- Of course.
00:12:25,172 --> 00:12:29,324  X1:115 X2:600 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yes. I was a Thigh Mega Tampon.
00:12:31,372 --> 00:12:32,327  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:524
What one?
00:12:32,532 --> 00:12:35,683  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:446 Y2:524
We were huge too.
But they had to shut us down...
00:12:35,932 --> 00:12:39,481  X1:175 X2:539 Y1:446 Y2:524
...when Regina Phalangie
died of alcohol poisoning.
00:12:39,732 --> 00:12:43,691  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:450 Y2:524
Isn't it a shame when one girl
ruins it for the whole bunch?
00:12:47,332 --> 00:12:48,685  X1:271 X2:443 Y1:484 Y2:524
Anyway... .
00:12:49,092 --> 00:12:52,129  X1:139 X2:577 Y1:450 Y2:524
Speaking of drinking too much,
I told Phoebe...
00:12:52,332 --> 00:12:56,769  X1:107 X2:608 Y1:446 Y2:524
...about that crazy night after the
Sigma Chi luau where we made out.
00:12:57,532 --> 00:12:58,601  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:03,966  X1:062 X2:655 Y1:446 Y2:524
Remember we... Come on, we had sarongs
on and the coconut bikini tops.
00:13:04,172 --> 00:13:07,130  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:446 Y2:524
We went back to the house
and got really silly...
00:13:07,372 --> 00:13:09,408  X1:212 X2:504 Y1:488 Y2:524
...and we made out.
00:13:09,652 --> 00:13:14,123  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:446 Y2:524
Wow, Ray-Ray, I have no idea
what you're talking about.
00:13:14,332 --> 00:13:15,924  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:484 Y2:524
Really?
00:13:21,852 --> 00:13:24,650  X1:240 X2:476 Y1:488 Y2:524
Ross is Batman.
00:13:25,932 --> 00:13:30,289  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:446 Y2:524
Well, he did manage to keep
his identity secret for a long time.
00:13:30,532 --> 00:13:34,684  X1:136 X2:578 Y1:450 Y2:524
Rachel got Ross the tuxedo
that Val Kilmer wore in <i>Batman.</i>
00:13:34,932 --> 00:13:37,526  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:450 Y2:524
Batman is so much cooler
than James Bond.
00:13:37,772 --> 00:13:42,527  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:446 Y2:524
- What? 007 has all those gadgets.
- Batman has a utility belt.
00:13:42,732 --> 00:13:47,283  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:450 Y2:524
- 007 has a fancy car.
- Batman has the Batmobile.
00:13:48,492 --> 00:13:53,612  X1:189 X2:526 Y1:450 Y2:524
- 007 gets all the ladies.
- Batman has Robin.
00:13:57,932 --> 00:14:00,571  X1:211 X2:506 Y1:484 Y2:524
We get ESPN, right?
00:14:02,772 --> 00:14:07,766  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:446 Y2:524
How about you go put on your 007
tuxedo, and I'll make you a martini?
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,803  X1:213 X2:502 Y1:488 Y2:524
I don't like martinis.
00:14:10,012 --> 00:14:13,607  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:450 Y2:524
- A Yoo-Hoo with a funny straw?
- Yum.
00:14:16,492 --> 00:14:18,722  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:484 Y2:524
I know the invitation says 6 p.m.
00:14:18,972 --> 00:14:22,760  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:450 Y2:524
But does that mean get there at 6,
or the show starts at 6?
00:14:22,972 --> 00:14:24,963  X1:273 X2:444 Y1:488 Y2:524
The show?
00:14:26,292 --> 00:14:29,682  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:484 Y2:524
Right, the wedding. Gotcha.
00:14:29,892 --> 00:14:33,009  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:446 Y2:524
But weddings start
a little late, right?
00:14:33,212 --> 00:14:35,806  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:446 Y2:524
Have you ever
been to one of my weddings?
00:14:36,932 --> 00:14:40,004  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:444 Y2:524
Well, it's the same day
as my niece's christening...
00:14:40,252 --> 00:14:42,402  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and I want my parents to see me.
00:14:42,652 --> 00:14:47,043  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:444 Y2:524
My part's in the beginning. I'm not
in the rest of the show... Wedding.
00:14:47,252 --> 00:14:49,208  X1:182 X2:532 Y1:484 Y2:524
The wedding starts at 6.
00:14:49,412 --> 00:14:51,767  X1:181 X2:534 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay. I totally hear you.
00:14:51,972 --> 00:14:54,611  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:446 Y2:524
How about this?
I vamp till they get there.
00:14:55,572 --> 00:14:56,607  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:482 Y2:524
You'll "vamp"?
00:14:56,852 --> 00:14:59,685  X1:181 X2:534 Y1:446 Y2:524
Like warm up the crowd.
Ask where they're from.
00:14:59,892 --> 00:15:04,090  X1:151 X2:563 Y1:450 Y2:524
In Joey Tribbianni, you get
a minister and an entertainer.
00:15:04,292 --> 00:15:06,010  X1:217 X2:498 Y1:488 Y2:524
I'm a "ministainer."
00:15:07,652 --> 00:15:10,530  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:444 Y2:524
There's no one better.
There's no one greater.
00:15:12,332 --> 00:15:14,721  X1:088 X2:630 Y1:484 Y2:524
How can you not remember us kissing?
00:15:14,932 --> 00:15:19,369  X1:108 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't know. I don't remember
a lot of things that never happened.
00:15:20,332 --> 00:15:24,769  X1:107 X2:610 Y1:446 Y2:524
Remember, we were on the sleeping
porch? We couldn't stop giggling.
00:15:24,972 --> 00:15:27,327  X1:097 X2:618 Y1:484 Y2:524
Our coconuts kept knocking together.
00:15:27,532 --> 00:15:30,729  X1:097 X2:618 Y1:482 Y2:524
Somewhere Joey's head is exploding.
00:15:31,532 --> 00:15:34,092  X1:150 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't want
to make you uncomfortable...
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:38,285  X1:133 X2:585 Y1:450 Y2:524
...but I told Phoebe it happened,
and she doesn't believe me.
00:15:38,532 --> 00:15:43,083  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm sorry. I mean, if I thought
it happened, I would say it.
00:15:43,332 --> 00:15:47,405  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:446 Y2:524
Maybe I passed out and you did stuff
to me while I was sleeping.
00:15:48,772 --> 00:15:51,764  X1:107 X2:608 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's okay, you don't have to do this.
I believe you.
00:15:52,012 --> 00:15:55,721  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:446 Y2:524
If you say you kissed Melissa,
then you kissed Melissa.
00:15:55,932 --> 00:15:58,810  X1:209 X2:506 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Thank you, Phoebe.
- Okay.
00:15:59,012 --> 00:16:01,480  X1:243 X2:473 Y1:450 Y2:524
- But she didn't.
- I know.
00:16:05,692 --> 00:16:07,205  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:484 Y2:524
You carry that around?
00:16:07,452 --> 00:16:11,001  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:446 Y2:524
I find it to be something
of a conversation piece.
00:16:12,052 --> 00:16:15,601  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Between you and...?
- Gunther.
00:16:15,852 --> 00:16:17,490  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:482 Y2:524
Why don't we put them on?
00:16:17,692 --> 00:16:20,525  X1:167 X2:547 Y1:446 Y2:524
Get a picture of Batman
and James Bond, together.
00:16:20,732 --> 00:16:23,087  X1:201 X2:517 Y1:446 Y2:524
I would, but my pants
are a little tight.
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:28,047  X1:103 X2:613 Y1:446 Y2:524
A little tight?
I could see 00 and 7 in those things.
00:16:28,252 --> 00:16:32,723  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:446 Y2:524
I was looking forward to wearing
our celebrity tuxes together.
00:16:32,932 --> 00:16:37,801  X1:082 X2:636 Y1:444 Y2:524
- So you're not gonna be wearing yours?
- Are you kidding? It's Batman's tux!
00:16:38,772 --> 00:16:40,763  X1:238 X2:477 Y1:484 Y2:524
Let me try it on.
00:16:41,012 --> 00:16:45,881  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:446 Y2:524
Okay. But just the jacket.
00 and 7 are not getting in there.
00:16:50,932 --> 00:16:54,322  X1:101 X2:614 Y1:484 Y2:524
Holy double-vented comfort, Batman!
00:16:56,092 --> 00:16:57,366  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:524
What's this?
00:16:57,572 --> 00:17:00,291  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:446 Y2:524
An invitation to
the <i>At First Sight</i> premiere?
00:17:00,492 --> 00:17:03,290  X1:209 X2:505 Y1:450 Y2:524
Val Kilmer didn't
wear this in <i>Batman. </i>
00:17:03,492 --> 00:17:08,282  X1:101 X2:615 Y1:446 Y2:524
He wore it to the premiere of a fruity
love story where he was a blind guy.
00:17:08,532 --> 00:17:10,284  X1:238 X2:478 Y1:488 Y2:524
Let me see that.
00:17:11,652 --> 00:17:13,085  X1:284 X2:431 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, man.
00:17:13,292 --> 00:17:18,082  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:446 Y2:524
The only super power you have is the
slightly heightened sense of smell.
00:17:19,492 --> 00:17:21,881  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:484 Y2:524
Can I talk to you guys for a second?
00:17:22,092 --> 00:17:24,925  X1:101 X2:614 Y1:446 Y2:524
I give up.
Whatever you want, you can have it.
00:17:25,172 --> 00:17:27,288  X1:081 X2:635 Y1:484 Y2:524
You want to sing a song or do a dance?
00:17:27,532 --> 00:17:32,401  X1:105 X2:609 Y1:446 Y2:524
You want your mom at the altar
screaming racial slurs? I don't care.
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:36,884  X1:130 X2:584 Y1:446 Y2:524
I just want to thank you guys
for what you did for my parents.
00:17:37,092 --> 00:17:40,482  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:524
They're so happy
to be a part of your special day.
00:17:41,372 --> 00:17:43,602  X1:103 X2:612 Y1:482 Y2:524
Tell them we're glad they're coming.
00:17:43,852 --> 00:17:48,846  X1:110 X2:608 Y1:446 Y2:524
I will. Oh, check out what they got
me to wear for the ceremony!
00:17:52,052 --> 00:17:55,681  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:446 Y2:524
I wear it like this when I
marry you guys. And then this...
00:17:55,932 --> 00:17:58,287  X1:221 X2:495 Y1:484 Y2:524
...is for party time.
00:18:04,092 --> 00:18:07,641  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:446 Y2:524
It happened.
I am telling you it happened.
00:18:07,852 --> 00:18:09,604  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:484 Y2:524
It was great meeting you.
00:18:09,852 --> 00:18:13,686  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:444 Y2:524
And, Rachel? I don't think
I'll be calling you because...
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:16,281  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:524
...you know, you've gotten weird.
00:18:17,812 --> 00:18:19,291  X1:206 X2:509 Y1:484 Y2:524
Take care, you guys.
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:21,807  X1:163 X2:551 Y1:484 Y2:524
Wait a minute. Okay, look.
00:18:22,052 --> 00:18:26,091  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:446 Y2:524
That night was the one wild thing
I've ever done in my life.
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:28,283  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:482 Y2:524
I won't let you take it away.
00:18:28,492 --> 00:18:32,770  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:444 Y2:524
So if you don't remember that,
maybe you'll remember this... .
00:18:38,812 --> 00:18:43,169  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God. You love me.
00:18:44,092 --> 00:18:45,002  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?
00:18:45,212 --> 00:18:48,887  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:450 Y2:524
Of course I remember.
I think about it all the time.
00:18:49,092 --> 00:18:53,563  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:446 Y2:524
I can still hear
the coconuts knocking together... .
00:18:54,452 --> 00:18:59,606  X1:108 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:524
I didn't want to tell you, because I
didn't think you'd return my love... .
00:19:02,172 --> 00:19:06,688  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:482 Y2:524
Look who's being suddenly shy.
00:19:06,892 --> 00:19:09,281  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:488 Y2:524
You have to feel what I feel.
00:19:09,492 --> 00:19:12,290  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:450 Y2:524
Nobody can kiss that good
and not mean it.
00:19:12,532 --> 00:19:15,683  X1:198 X2:517 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm just a good kisser.
00:19:15,932 --> 00:19:18,127  X1:287 X2:427 Y1:484 Y2:524
Shut up.
00:19:19,132 --> 00:19:20,531  X1:281 X2:434 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm sorry.
00:19:23,532 --> 00:19:26,888  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:482 Y2:524
You don't have to be sorry.
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:30,010  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm obviously kidding.
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:34,211  X1:183 X2:532 Y1:450 Y2:524
I'm not in love with you.
I'm not in love with her.
00:19:34,452 --> 00:19:38,650  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't hear coconuts
banging together.
00:19:38,852 --> 00:19:43,084  X1:116 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't picture your face
when I make love to my boyfriend.
00:19:43,972 --> 00:19:45,485  X1:213 X2:502 Y1:484 Y2:524
Anyway, I gotta go.
00:19:45,732 --> 00:19:47,802  X1:236 X2:480 Y1:484 Y2:524
A kiss goodbye?
00:19:48,052 --> 00:19:50,691  X1:272 X2:443 Y1:484 Y2:524
No? Okay.
00:19:59,972 --> 00:20:03,681  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:450 Y2:524
I mean, I had no idea
that that would... .
00:20:09,532 --> 00:20:10,885  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:524
What the hell was that?
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:14,289  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:450 Y2:524
Just wanted to see
what all the fuss was about.
00:20:14,532 --> 00:20:17,000  X1:239 X2:477 Y1:450 Y2:524
- And?
- I've had better.
00:20:24,412 --> 00:20:25,891  X1:209 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:524
I found one that fits.
00:20:26,132 --> 00:20:30,728  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:052 Y2:126
Well, you know what they say?
00:20:33,412 --> 00:20:35,562  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:052 Y2:093
Look at you, all handsome.
00:20:36,332 --> 00:20:38,129  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:052 Y2:126
- Whose is it?
- Does it matter?
00:20:38,372 --> 00:20:41,523  X1:146 X2:568 Y1:052 Y2:131
All that matters
is that you look so handsome.
00:20:44,692 --> 00:20:47,729  X1:209 X2:506 Y1:052 Y2:131
- Whose is it?
- I don't want to say.
00:20:48,132 --> 00:20:51,044  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:052 Y2:091
Come on, I don't care. Whose is it?
00:20:51,732 --> 00:20:53,609  X1:253 X2:462 Y1:052 Y2:088
Diane Keaton.
