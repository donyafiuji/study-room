00:00:05,373 --> 00:00:08,092  X1:121 X2:596 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, hey! How was your audition?
00:00:08,693 --> 00:00:10,729  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm sorry, do I know you?
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:13,407  X1:208 X2:508 Y1:482 Y2:523
What are you doing?
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:17,128  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:523
Practicing blowing you off.
I'm gonna be a big movie star!
00:00:17,453 --> 00:00:18,283  X1:272 X2:445 Y1:482 Y2:523
You got it?
00:00:18,493 --> 00:00:21,883  X1:099 X2:617 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Not yet, but the audition went great!
- What's it for?
00:00:22,093 --> 00:00:25,529  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:450 Y2:523
A big-budget period movie about
three Italian brothers...
00:00:25,773 --> 00:00:29,368  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:444 Y2:523
...who come to America at the turn
of the century. It's classy.
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:33,572  X1:142 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:523
The director's supposed to be
the next-next Martin Scorsese.
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,527  X1:232 X2:484 Y1:486 Y2:523
The "next-next"?
00:00:36,773 --> 00:00:40,482  X1:096 X2:620 Y1:448 Y2:523
A guy from Chicago's supposed to be
the next Martin Scorsese.
00:00:40,693 --> 00:00:42,604  X1:173 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:523
This guy's right after him.
00:00:45,893 --> 00:00:46,803  X1:305 X2:412 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hello?
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:52,565  X1:104 X2:610 Y1:444 Y2:523
Joey, it's Estelle. I just talked to
the casting people. They loved you!
00:00:52,773 --> 00:00:53,808  X1:243 X2:471 Y1:482 Y2:523
They loved me!
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,368  X1:090 X2:625 Y1:482 Y2:523
They want to see you again tomorrow.
00:00:57,573 --> 00:00:59,564  X1:190 X2:523 Y1:444 Y2:523
- My God!
00:00:59,773 --> 00:01:03,322  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:444 Y2:523
Do you have a problem
with full-frontal nudity?
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:08,728  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:450 Y2:523
Are you kidding me? I never
rent a movie without it!
00:01:09,693 --> 00:01:10,489  X1:321 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh.
00:01:12,653 --> 00:01:15,087  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, let me call you back.
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:18,803  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:444 Y2:523
- What's the matter?
- They want me naked in the movie.
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:20,207  X1:290 X2:425 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Wow!
- I know.
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:25,328  X1:097 X2:618 Y1:444 Y2:523
- My grandmother's gonna see this.
- Grandma's gonna have to get in line.
00:01:27,013 --> 00:01:29,083  X1:077 X2:640 Y1:486 Y2:523
The One With Ross and Monica's Cousin
00:01:31,533 --> 00:01:32,522  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:444 Y2:523
English Subtitles by
SDI Media Group
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:08,361  X1:184 X2:530 Y1:054 Y2:133
The wedding's so close.
Are you nervous?
00:02:08,613 --> 00:02:11,332  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:054 Y2:128
Yeah, but I also can't
wait till it's over.
00:02:11,573 --> 00:02:14,326  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:054 Y2:132
We have a pact not to have sex
again until the wedding.
00:02:14,573 --> 00:02:17,133  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:054 Y2:095
A "no sex" pact, huh?
00:02:17,773 --> 00:02:21,243  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:054 Y2:132
I have one of those with
every woman in America.
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:26,325  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:054 Y2:132
Will you give me a hand
making up the guest bedroom?
00:02:26,573 --> 00:02:28,928  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:054 Y2:133
Cousin Cassie's staying with us
for a few days.
00:02:29,173 --> 00:02:32,324  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:054 Y2:130
Cassie? I haven't seen her
in, like, forever.
00:02:32,573 --> 00:02:35,451  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:054 Y2:132
I wonder if she still carries
a Barbie everywhere?
00:02:35,653 --> 00:02:38,042  X1:212 X2:504 Y1:448 Y2:523
- She's 25 years old.
- So? I still...
00:02:38,293 --> 00:02:39,646  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:482 Y2:523
You're probably right.
00:02:42,893 --> 00:02:45,726  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:054 Y2:127
Pheebs, can I talk to you
over here for a second?
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:47,852  X1:257 X2:458 Y1:482 Y2:523
Subtle, guys.
00:02:49,173 --> 00:02:50,162  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:523
What?
00:02:50,373 --> 00:02:54,127  X1:171 X2:548 Y1:054 Y2:133
I know you're planning my
surprise bridal shower.
00:02:54,893 --> 00:02:59,011  X1:180 X2:533 Y1:054 Y2:133
Okay, well, don't ruin it.
Just play along, at least.
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:01,044  X1:257 X2:458 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay. Sorry.
00:03:02,613 --> 00:03:04,604  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
We have to throw her a shower?
00:03:09,973 --> 00:03:12,441  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:448 Y2:523
What'd you decide to do
about the movie?
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:13,967  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:486 Y2:523
I don't know.
00:03:15,093 --> 00:03:19,052  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:523
It's not like it's porn.
This is a serious, legitimate movie.
00:03:19,253 --> 00:03:21,483  X1:185 X2:534 Y1:444 Y2:523
Nudity's really important
to the story.
00:03:21,693 --> 00:03:23,763  X1:129 X2:585 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's what you say about porn.
00:03:24,653 --> 00:03:26,848  X1:097 X2:618 Y1:482 Y2:523
Maybe I shouldn't go on the callback.
00:03:27,053 --> 00:03:30,966  X1:141 X2:578 Y1:450 Y2:523
No, you should. A lot of major
actors do nude scenes.
00:03:31,173 --> 00:03:33,562  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:450 Y2:523
The chance to star in a movie?
Come on!
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:39,168  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:444 Y2:523
That's true. And I'm only naked in
one scene. It sounds really great.
00:03:39,373 --> 00:03:42,445  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:523
My character's Catholic. He falls
in love with a Jewish girl.
00:03:42,693 --> 00:03:45,332  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:444 Y2:523
We run away and get caught
in a big rainstorm.
00:03:45,573 --> 00:03:49,327  X1:091 X2:626 Y1:450 Y2:523
We go into a barn, undress each other
and hold each other.
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:51,683  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's really sweet and tender.
00:03:51,893 --> 00:03:54,009  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:482 Y2:523
Plus, everyone will see your thing!
00:03:57,813 --> 00:03:59,769  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
When can we have this shower?
00:04:00,013 --> 00:04:03,130  X1:165 X2:551 Y1:444 Y2:523
She has so much going on,
we have only two options.
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:06,370  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:523
- We have Friday.
- That's just two days away.
00:04:06,573 --> 00:04:09,133  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:444 Y2:523
- What is the other option?
- Yesterday.
00:04:09,773 --> 00:04:12,446  X1:103 X2:612 Y1:482 Y2:523
If we make it yesterday, we're done!
00:04:12,973 --> 00:04:15,168  X1:165 X2:549 Y1:444 Y2:523
It's impossible.
We can't do this by Friday.
00:04:15,413 --> 00:04:18,132  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:444 Y2:523
We have to find a place,
invite people, get food.
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,051  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:486 Y2:523
There's too much to do.
00:04:20,253 --> 00:04:22,721  X1:230 X2:486 Y1:450 Y2:523
- We cannot do it!
- Calm down!
00:04:22,933 --> 00:04:25,845  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay. I'm sorry, you're right.
I'm sorry.
00:04:26,053 --> 00:04:27,486  X1:178 X2:536 Y1:486 Y2:523
Just calm down, woman!
00:04:30,173 --> 00:04:31,970  X1:202 X2:513 Y1:482 Y2:523
Phoebe, I already did.
00:04:32,173 --> 00:04:34,482  X1:110 X2:605 Y1:482 Y2:523
All right, then I need to calm down.
00:04:36,053 --> 00:04:38,692  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:444 Y2:523
I think we can do this
if we just get organized.
00:04:38,893 --> 00:04:42,932  X1:101 X2:614 Y1:450 Y2:523
We have two days to plan this party.
We need to make fast decisions.
00:04:43,173 --> 00:04:44,652  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:488 Y2:523
Where will we have it?
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:47,407  X1:221 X2:496 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Here. What time?
- 4:00. Food?
00:04:47,613 --> 00:04:50,685  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Finger sandwiches and tea.
- Great! Very Monica.
00:04:50,893 --> 00:04:53,123  X1:195 X2:520 Y1:450 Y2:523
- And chili!
- You went one too far.
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:56,524  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Flowers or balloons?
- Both.
00:04:56,773 --> 00:04:58,729  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:448 Y2:523
- We're paying for this.
- Neither.
00:04:59,893 --> 00:05:04,125  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:450 Y2:523
- What should we do for a theme?
- Lusts of the Flesh!
00:05:05,693 --> 00:05:08,765  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:444 Y2:523
- What?
- I don't know. Cowboy theme?
00:05:13,893 --> 00:05:17,329  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm glad we decided not to sleep
together before the wedding.
00:05:17,813 --> 00:05:19,531  X1:227 X2:488 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, boy. Me too.
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:25,122  X1:092 X2:625 Y1:444 Y2:523
I was thinking, say we had a big fight,
and broke up for a few hours.
00:05:25,453 --> 00:05:28,445  X1:095 X2:620 Y1:482 Y2:523
Technically, we could have sex again.
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:32,288  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:444 Y2:523
What do you think,
bossy and domineering?
00:05:32,493 --> 00:05:35,007  X1:203 X2:511 Y1:444 Y2:523
The wedding's off,
sloppy and immature.
00:05:35,213 --> 00:05:36,487  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:486 Y2:523
That's me. Come on.
00:05:36,733 --> 00:05:39,964  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:444 Y2:523
Wait. Cassie's in the guest room.
We're going to lunch.
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,209  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:486 Y2:523
Get rid of her, obsessive and shrill!
00:05:43,373 --> 00:05:45,523  X1:133 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:523
Shrill? The wedding is back on.
00:05:47,773 --> 00:05:50,845  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:450 Y2:523
I thought I heard voices.
You must be Chandler.
00:05:51,493 --> 00:05:54,405  X1:195 X2:520 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.
00:05:54,613 --> 00:05:56,524  X1:231 X2:487 Y1:450 Y2:523
- So, ready to go?
- Yeah.
00:06:14,253 --> 00:06:16,926  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Chandler?
- I'll be right with you.
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,681  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Cassie needs to stay at your place.
- Why?
00:06:21,893 --> 00:06:25,681  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:444 Y2:523
Because "Pervie Perverson" here
can't stop staring at her.
00:06:25,893 --> 00:06:27,963  X1:165 X2:551 Y1:484 Y2:523
Chandler, she's our cousin!
00:06:28,173 --> 00:06:31,051  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:444 Y2:523
I wasn't staring.
I was listening intently.
00:06:31,253 --> 00:06:34,529  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:448 Y2:523
It's called being a good
conversationalist. Watch.
00:06:34,893 --> 00:06:36,121  X1:243 X2:472 Y1:482 Y2:523
Say something.
00:06:36,573 --> 00:06:39,690  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:450 Y2:523
You were staring about eight inches
south of there.
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,683  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:482 Y2:523
Fine. She can stay at my place.
00:06:42,893 --> 00:06:45,043  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:488 Y2:523
What does Cassie look like now?
00:06:45,253 --> 00:06:46,845  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:482 Y2:523
Exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
00:06:47,853 --> 00:06:50,651  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:444 Y2:523
This Aunt Marilyn,
is she coming to the wedding?
00:06:50,853 --> 00:06:52,684  X1:247 X2:468 Y1:488 Y2:523
Wafer-thin ice.
00:06:58,133 --> 00:06:59,088  X1:249 X2:467 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey, I'm back.
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,090  X1:286 X2:430 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hi, Joey.
00:07:01,373 --> 00:07:03,568  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:482 Y2:523
Will I read the same scene again?
00:07:03,813 --> 00:07:07,010  X1:136 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:523
I tried to call you.
You didn't need to come today.
00:07:07,213 --> 00:07:08,566  X1:278 X2:437 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, great.
00:07:09,493 --> 00:07:11,768  X1:118 X2:597 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'd have been perfect for this part.
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:15,249  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:444 Y2:523
You made a bad decision and
ruined your movie. Good day!
00:07:15,573 --> 00:07:20,124  X1:094 X2:623 Y1:444 Y2:523
You didn't need to come, because the
director saw your tape and loved it.
00:07:22,493 --> 00:07:24,529  X1:273 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
End scene.
00:07:26,573 --> 00:07:30,930  X1:164 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:523
Wasn't that fun? We did
a little improv there. Yeah!
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:33,725  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:482 Y2:523
So, you were saying?
00:07:33,973 --> 00:07:36,441  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:450 Y2:523
The director wants to meet you
tomorrow.
00:07:36,653 --> 00:07:38,689  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:482 Y2:523
Wow! Sure! That's great.
00:07:38,893 --> 00:07:41,043  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:444 Y2:523
Your agent said you're okay
with nudity.
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:44,245  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah, sure. As long as
it's handled tastefully.
00:07:44,493 --> 00:07:46,723  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:488 Y2:523
And that barn is not too cold.
00:07:49,693 --> 00:07:51,888  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:482 Y2:523
Perfect. There's one more thing.
00:07:52,093 --> 00:07:57,042  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:523
It's important to the director that
everything in the movie's authentic.
00:07:57,933 --> 00:07:59,969  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:523
In your love scene with Sarah...
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:04,729  X1:089 X2:626 Y1:448 Y2:523
...she talks about how she's never
seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish.
00:08:04,973 --> 00:08:05,769  X1:306 X2:408 Y1:488 Y2:523
So... .
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:10,285  X1:272 X2:444 Y1:488 Y2:523
So... what?
00:08:10,653 --> 00:08:15,204  X1:150 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:523
So, the director is insisting
that whoever play that part...
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:18,923  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:482 Y2:523
...be authentically, anatomically...
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:21,727  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:523
...not Jewish.
You know what I'm saying?
00:08:21,973 --> 00:08:23,167  X1:315 X2:400 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes!
00:08:23,973 --> 00:08:25,167  X1:271 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
No. What?
00:08:27,813 --> 00:08:31,852  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:450 Y2:523
An Italian Catholic immigrant
at this time would not be... .
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,281  X1:241 X2:476 Y1:488 Y2:523
Bar mitzvah-ed?
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,688  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:448 Y2:523
- To get this part, you can't be...
- No.
00:08:40,893 --> 00:08:41,882  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:482 Y2:523
But you are?
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:44,488  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:444 Y2:523
- You told them you weren't?
- That's right.
00:08:45,453 --> 00:08:46,681  X1:305 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:523
Wow!
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,928  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:444 Y2:523
It's definitely all gone?
There's nothing there to work with?
00:08:54,453 --> 00:08:58,207  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:444 Y2:523
- What were you thinking?
- I don't know. I just want this part.
00:08:58,453 --> 00:09:02,207  X1:092 X2:624 Y1:444 Y2:523
They say no matter what you're asked
during an audition, say yes.
00:09:02,413 --> 00:09:04,927  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:444 Y2:523
They want you to ride a horse,
say you can.
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:07,522  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:482 Y2:523
You figure out how to do it later.
00:09:07,733 --> 00:09:13,330  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:444 Y2:523
This is not like learning to ride
a horse. This is like learning to...
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:15,444  X1:211 X2:506 Y1:482 Y2:523
...grow a turtleneck.
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:25,847  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:444 Y2:523
I know, okay? Tomorrow,
when I go meet the director...
00:09:26,053 --> 00:09:29,762  X1:092 X2:623 Y1:444 Y2:523
...I have to take my clothes off so
they can see what my body looks like.
00:09:29,973 --> 00:09:32,487  X1:091 X2:626 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God. What are you gonna do?
00:09:33,093 --> 00:09:36,483  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:523
I have to call my agent and
tell her I can't do the part.
00:09:38,053 --> 00:09:39,406  X1:282 X2:434 Y1:488 Y2:523
Unless... .
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:42,043  X1:258 X2:460 Y1:488 Y2:523
Unless what?
00:09:42,253 --> 00:09:46,246  X1:101 X2:616 Y1:444 Y2:523
This may sound crazy, but there may
be something we could...
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:47,647  X1:278 X2:438 Y1:488 Y2:523
...fashion.
00:09:51,573 --> 00:09:54,531  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Like what?
- Well, I'm not sure yet.
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:57,611  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:444 Y2:523
Off the top of my head,
I'm thinking...
00:09:57,893 --> 00:10:01,442  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:450 Y2:523
...double-sided tape
and some sort of luncheon meat.
00:10:07,933 --> 00:10:11,642  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:448 Y2:523
I've got a great idea for party
favors for the shower.
00:10:11,853 --> 00:10:15,482  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:444 Y2:523
We get mahogany boxes and
carve everyone's names in them.
00:10:15,733 --> 00:10:19,282  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:448 Y2:523
Then inside is each person's
individual birthstone.
00:10:21,013 --> 00:10:23,163  X1:259 X2:456 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay. Okay.
00:10:24,733 --> 00:10:26,689  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
You take care of that.
00:10:28,053 --> 00:10:32,205  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:444 Y2:523
Meanwhile, the party's tomorrow
and we don't have a guest list.
00:10:32,453 --> 00:10:36,765  X1:081 X2:636 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay. Who do we know that's coming?
Me. Are you?
00:10:40,213 --> 00:10:41,532  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?
00:10:41,773 --> 00:10:45,083  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm making something for Joey.
Can I raid your fridge?
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,686  X1:276 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
Have at it.
00:10:48,093 --> 00:10:51,927  X1:102 X2:612 Y1:482 Y2:523
All right. Turkey? That won't work.
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:54,522  X1:167 X2:549 Y1:486 Y2:523
Cheese? That won't work.
00:10:54,853 --> 00:10:58,084  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:482 Y2:523
Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,688  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:482 Y2:523
Are you making him a sandwich?
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:05,328  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:482 Y2:523
No, it's more like a wrap.
00:11:07,693 --> 00:11:09,684  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, so I'm gonna go, guys.
00:11:09,933 --> 00:11:14,290  X1:111 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:523
So you can get back to deciding on
what to get me for a present!
00:11:17,213 --> 00:11:19,602  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:482 Y2:523
We have to get her a present?
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:23,325  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, but look. Look at what I got.
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:26,684  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:444 Y2:523
It's her address book.
We have a guest list.
00:11:28,373 --> 00:11:31,524  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:444 Y2:523
You're amazing. Did you pull
that out of her purse?
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:35,169  X1:129 X2:590 Y1:444 Y2:523
Uh-huh. And a little seed money
for the party.
00:11:43,813 --> 00:11:45,087  X1:295 X2:422 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cassie?
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:46,802  X1:274 X2:442 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey, Ross!
00:11:48,493 --> 00:11:50,768  X1:230 X2:486 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's been so long!
00:11:51,573 --> 00:11:52,892  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:482 Y2:523
Last time I saw you...
00:11:53,093 --> 00:11:56,722  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:450 Y2:523
...you were setting up your tent
in line for <i>Return of the Jedi. </i>
00:11:58,413 --> 00:12:02,770  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:444 Y2:523
So you did see me that day.
Because it seemed like you didn't.
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:07,443  X1:188 X2:528 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Yeah, sorry about that.
- It's okay. Come on in.
00:12:07,653 --> 00:12:11,487  X1:134 X2:580 Y1:444 Y2:523
Thanks for letting me stay here.
Monica's place was nice.
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:14,964  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:488 Y2:523
But her fiancé sure stares a lot.
00:12:35,853 --> 00:12:39,368  X1:088 X2:628 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God! You do a great Chandler!
00:12:43,373 --> 00:12:45,728  X1:140 X2:575 Y1:482 Y2:523
I have a knack for impressions.
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:48,891  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:444 Y2:523
Maybe after we get re-acquainted
you could do me.
00:12:49,133 --> 00:12:50,452  X1:274 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah. No!
00:13:00,453 --> 00:13:02,967  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:482 Y2:523
How you doing on that...
00:13:03,173 --> 00:13:04,606  X1:273 X2:445 Y1:482 Y2:523
...hot dog?
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:09,613  X1:258 X2:458 Y1:448 Y2:523
- I'm all done.
- Thank God.
00:13:12,253 --> 00:13:16,849  X1:101 X2:616 Y1:444 Y2:523
The last time we hung out was when
our parents rented that beach house.
00:13:17,053 --> 00:13:21,729  X1:093 X2:625 Y1:444 Y2:523
Remember the time I pinned you down
and tickled you until you cried?
00:13:23,493 --> 00:13:26,405  X1:087 X2:628 Y1:482 Y2:523
We're probably too old to do that now.
00:13:28,613 --> 00:13:33,209  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'll always remember that summer.
It's when I got all these freckles.
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,651  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'll always remember that summer...
00:13:38,893 --> 00:13:42,408  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:523
...because that's when I realized
that we are related.
00:13:42,933 --> 00:13:45,367  X1:210 X2:506 Y1:444 Y2:523
It took you that long
to figure it out?
00:13:45,573 --> 00:13:46,847  X1:238 X2:477 Y1:486 Y2:523
I'm a little slow.
00:13:48,813 --> 00:13:51,281  X1:144 X2:570 Y1:488 Y2:523
Just as our children would be.
00:13:58,093 --> 00:13:59,162  X1:321 X2:394 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Hi.
- Hi.
00:13:59,413 --> 00:14:02,450  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:444 Y2:523
How are you? Good. Hi.
Thanks for coming.
00:14:02,653 --> 00:14:04,769  X1:133 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:523
Thank you. So nice to see you.
00:14:05,013 --> 00:14:07,652  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:444 Y2:523
- No, thanks.
- Okay. Hey, Rach?
00:14:07,893 --> 00:14:10,327  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Yeah?
- Who the hell are all these people?
00:14:11,293 --> 00:14:13,853  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:444 Y2:523
I don't know.
I called everybody in her book.
00:14:14,093 --> 00:14:17,802  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:444 Y2:523
These are the ones that could
show up on 24 hours' notice.
00:14:18,013 --> 00:14:21,005  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:448 Y2:523
There's a word for people like that:
Losers.
00:14:22,533 --> 00:14:25,889  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:523
Hi, I'm Rachel. This is Phoebe.
I'm the maid of honor.
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:29,569  X1:098 X2:618 Y1:444 Y2:523
- How do you know Monica?
- I was her accountant four years ago.
00:14:29,853 --> 00:14:34,768  X1:101 X2:617 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm interested to find out who's been
doing her taxes the last four years.
00:14:35,693 --> 00:14:37,251  X1:259 X2:455 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's great.
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:42,162  X1:085 X2:632 Y1:450 Y2:523
- When is Monica supposed to get here?
- I don't know.
00:14:43,533 --> 00:14:44,727  X1:274 X2:442 Y1:488 Y2:523
Excuse us.
00:14:46,813 --> 00:14:49,646  X1:188 X2:527 Y1:444 Y2:523
- You didn't tell her?
- You were supposed to.
00:14:49,893 --> 00:14:53,363  X1:085 X2:630 Y1:444 Y2:523
You were supposed to tell her to come!
I was bringing the cake!
00:14:53,573 --> 00:14:57,532  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Fine, I'll go call her.
- And please tell her to bring a cake!
00:15:03,693 --> 00:15:08,244  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:444 Y2:523
We have a lot of options. A number
of prototypes for you to try on.
00:15:09,373 --> 00:15:10,408  X1:229 X2:485 Y1:482 Y2:523
Those look great.
00:15:10,613 --> 00:15:15,129  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay, this one's a mushroom cap.
This one is made of bologna.
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,972  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:444 Y2:523
- The toothpicks?
- Just until the glue dries.
00:15:18,173 --> 00:15:19,322  X1:268 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thank God.
00:15:20,973 --> 00:15:23,612  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:444 Y2:523
These are more realistic,
but perishable.
00:15:24,453 --> 00:15:27,570  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:450 Y2:523
Over here, we have pink suede,
which is nice.
00:15:27,813 --> 00:15:30,088  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:482 Y2:523
But if it gets wet, it'll shrink.
00:15:30,293 --> 00:15:32,727  X1:213 X2:502 Y1:444 Y2:523
Maybe we'll just
take that one away.
00:15:33,853 --> 00:15:38,404  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:444 Y2:523
I also did a little something in fur,
but that's really just for me.
00:15:41,293 --> 00:15:45,286  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:444 Y2:523
Why don't you try these on? We'll
get a better idea of what works.
00:15:45,493 --> 00:15:48,883  X1:106 X2:608 Y1:450 Y2:523
Thanks, you are such a good friend.
And this is so weird.
00:15:56,573 --> 00:15:58,370  X1:268 X2:449 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Toothpick?
- Yeah.
00:16:00,013 --> 00:16:02,527  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:444 Y2:523
- What are you trying now?
- The Fruit Roll-up.
00:16:02,773 --> 00:16:04,525  X1:276 X2:439 Y1:450 Y2:523
- And?
- Delicious.
00:16:07,173 --> 00:16:10,290  X1:142 X2:572 Y1:450 Y2:523
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
We have a winner!
00:16:10,493 --> 00:16:12,051  X1:216 X2:500 Y1:488 Y2:523
What? Which one?
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:16,323  X1:207 X2:509 Y1:444 Y2:523
The Silly Putty.
Not so silly anymore!
00:16:25,653 --> 00:16:30,249  X1:221 X2:492 Y1:444 Y2:523
00:16:30,933 --> 00:16:36,132  X1:097 X2:618 Y1:444 Y2:523
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:45,721  X1:162 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:523
00:16:45,973 --> 00:16:50,649  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:523
00:16:50,853 --> 00:16:53,731  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:444 Y2:523
00:16:53,933 --> 00:16:57,892  X1:102 X2:617 Y1:444 Y2:523
Logan's Run...
00:16:58,093 --> 00:17:00,482  X1:177 X2:536 Y1:488 Y2:523
00:17:03,813 --> 00:17:05,690  X1:231 X2:482 Y1:488 Y2:523
00:17:05,893 --> 00:17:10,045  X1:116 X2:596 Y1:482 Y2:523
00:17:10,253 --> 00:17:11,732  X1:260 X2:453 Y1:482 Y2:523
00:17:21,413 --> 00:17:23,324  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:482 Y2:523
What the hell are you doing?
00:17:24,653 --> 00:17:26,530  X1:199 X2:514 Y1:482 Y2:523
00:17:28,773 --> 00:17:31,333  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:523
00:17:31,533 --> 00:17:34,525  X1:077 X2:636 Y1:482 Y2:523
00:17:35,293 --> 00:17:38,330  X1:218 X2:493 Y1:482 Y2:523
00:17:39,773 --> 00:17:42,412  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:482 Y2:523
00:17:42,653 --> 00:17:47,010  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:482 Y2:523
00:17:48,653 --> 00:17:52,612  X1:145 X2:576 Y1:450 Y2:523
00:17:52,813 --> 00:17:54,531  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:482 Y2:523
00:17:56,573 --> 00:18:00,122  X1:100 X2:616 Y1:482 Y2:523
I haven't had sex in a very long time.
00:18:03,653 --> 00:18:06,406  X1:176 X2:547 Y1:444 Y2:523
00:18:09,013 --> 00:18:11,049  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:486 Y2:523
Phoebe? Rachel? It's Monica.
00:18:11,253 --> 00:18:15,371  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:450 Y2:523
I wonder what you could possibly
need me for on such short notice?
00:18:19,853 --> 00:18:23,528  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Oh, Monica. We are so sorry.
- For what?
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:27,328  X1:167 X2:547 Y1:444 Y2:523
First, for forgetting to
throw you a bridal shower.
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,882  X1:115 X2:599 Y1:482 Y2:523
Then, forgetting to invite you to it.
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,607  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:482 Y2:523
You already had it?
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:37,123  X1:080 X2:634 Y1:444 Y2:523
We called everyone in your phone book.
A bunch of people came.
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:40,405  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:444 Y2:523
It took us so long to get you here
that they had to leave.
00:18:41,293 --> 00:18:45,332  X1:088 X2:629 Y1:444 Y2:523
We wanted to throw you a big surprise
and a great shower.
00:18:45,533 --> 00:18:47,330  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:523
Now you don't have either.
00:18:47,533 --> 00:18:48,886  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:482 Y2:523
We ruined everything.
00:18:49,093 --> 00:18:53,644  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, wait a minute, that's not true.
What you did was really sweet.
00:18:53,893 --> 00:18:57,363  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:523
- It kind of works out for the best.
- What do you mean?
00:18:57,613 --> 00:19:01,765  X1:125 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:523
Now I get to spend my shower
with the only people I really love.
00:19:01,973 --> 00:19:06,603  X1:119 X2:595 Y1:444 Y2:523
I get all those presents without
talking to people I don't even like!
00:19:12,253 --> 00:19:14,164  X1:225 X2:491 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Surprise.
- Surprise, Monica.
00:19:20,373 --> 00:19:23,922  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:523
What's cool is, the character
is from Naples, right?
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:26,408  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:482 Y2:523
My whole family's from Naples.
00:19:26,653 --> 00:19:31,568  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:444 Y2:523
That's great. Okay. I've heard
everything I need to hear... .
00:19:31,933 --> 00:19:34,128  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:482 Y2:523
We just need to, uh... .
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:35,683  X1:301 X2:417 Y1:488 Y2:523
Leslie?
00:19:36,253 --> 00:19:40,371  X1:135 X2:580 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Joey, this is the awkward part.
- Hey, right. Not a problem.
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,763  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:523
I totally understand you need to...
00:19:43,013 --> 00:19:46,562  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:448 Y2:523
...make sure I don't have any
horrible scars or tattoos.
00:19:46,773 --> 00:19:48,126  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:482 Y2:523
Don't you worry.
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:51,128  X1:196 X2:519 Y1:482 Y2:523
I have nothing to hide.
00:19:52,373 --> 00:19:55,171  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:482 Y2:523
So, there you go. That's me.
00:19:55,373 --> 00:19:57,648  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:482 Y2:523
One hundred-percent natural.
00:20:12,693 --> 00:20:16,129  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:444 Y2:523
I tell you, that has never
happened before.
00:20:21,693 --> 00:20:23,843  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:444 Y2:523
Cassie, are you finding
everything okay?
00:20:24,093 --> 00:20:26,732  X1:209 X2:506 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah. Thanks for
letting me stay here.
00:20:26,933 --> 00:20:29,049  X1:213 X2:502 Y1:054 Y2:095
Oh, it's no problem.
00:20:46,493 --> 00:20:47,482  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:054 Y2:089
What?
00:20:48,053 --> 00:20:50,521  X1:143 X2:570 Y1:054 Y2:094
00:20:50,973 --> 00:20:53,533  X1:102 X2:614 Y1:054 Y2:094
