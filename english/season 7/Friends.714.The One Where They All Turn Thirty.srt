00:00:06,093 --> 00:00:07,208  X1:241 X2:474 Y1:484 Y2:524
Happy birthday!
00:00:07,413 --> 00:00:08,289  X1:241 X2:474 Y1:484 Y2:524
Happy birthday!
00:00:11,413 --> 00:00:13,005  X1:242 X2:474 Y1:486 Y2:524
Rach, come on.
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:14,568  X1:227 X2:488 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's your birthday!
00:00:15,373 --> 00:00:16,362  X1:300 X2:416 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey... .
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:20,965  X1:164 X2:550 Y1:450 Y2:524
She's not as pretty as
she was when she was 29.
00:00:22,053 --> 00:00:26,490  X1:107 X2:611 Y1:446 Y2:524
Ms. Greene wants to establish some
ground rules before she comes out.
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,924  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:450 Y2:524
Please don't use the words
"old" or "downhill"...
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:32,522  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:444 Y2:524
...or "They still look
pretty damn good. "
00:00:36,493 --> 00:00:37,642  X1:286 X2:429 Y1:484 Y2:524
They do.
00:00:38,853 --> 00:00:40,571  X1:205 X2:511 Y1:486 Y2:524
Rachel, come on out.
00:00:41,053 --> 00:00:42,611  X1:188 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:524
Monica made breakfast.
00:00:42,813 --> 00:00:44,212  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:484 Y2:524
Chocolate chip pancakes.
00:00:45,173 --> 00:00:46,492  X1:211 X2:503 Y1:482 Y2:524
We've got presents.
00:00:49,453 --> 00:00:50,283  X1:267 X2:450 Y1:488 Y2:524
Good ones?
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:54,564  X1:155 X2:559 Y1:444 Y2:524
They're all from the list
you gave us two weeks ago.
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:58,045  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:450 Y2:524
Can I keep the presents
and still be 29?
00:00:59,053 --> 00:01:02,329  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:446 Y2:524
Come on, Rach, turning 30
is not that big a deal.
00:01:02,693 --> 00:01:05,366  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:446 Y2:524
Really? Is that how you felt
when you turned 30?
00:01:05,613 --> 00:01:07,524  X1:234 X2:482 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why, God, why?
00:01:08,173 --> 00:01:11,563  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:446 Y2:524
We had a deal.
Let the others grow old, not me!
00:01:15,053 --> 00:01:17,567  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:446 Y2:524
You guys, is it just me?
Am I overreacting?
00:01:17,773 --> 00:01:22,244  X1:080 X2:636 Y1:444 Y2:524
No, it's not just you.
My 30th birthday sure wasn't much fun.
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:24,412  X1:218 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:524
And now Chandler!
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:28,164  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:482 Y2:524
We're all getting so old.
00:01:28,373 --> 00:01:30,807  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why are You doing this to us?
00:01:34,853 --> 00:01:36,889  X1:107 X2:611 Y1:484 Y2:524
The One Where They All Turn Thirty

00:02:11,853 --> 00:02:16,290  X1:084 X2:630 Y1:052 Y2:132
You're in a great place in your life.
You have an amazing job, good friends.
00:02:16,573 --> 00:02:18,564  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:482 Y2:524
Your roommate's a soap opera star.
00:02:18,853 --> 00:02:20,571  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:488 Y2:524
Your character is in a coma.
00:02:22,773 --> 00:02:25,571  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:052 Y2:131
I promised myself
I wouldn't cry at this one.
00:02:27,093 --> 00:02:30,483  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:052 Y2:132
I know my life's going pretty well,
but I see so many people...
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:33,964  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:052 Y2:132
...who've accomplished their goals
before they're 30.
00:02:34,173 --> 00:02:36,892  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:444 Y2:524
Yeah, but you shouldn't compare
yourself to me.
00:02:37,973 --> 00:02:40,168  X1:220 X2:496 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Come on, Phoebe!
- You can do it!
00:02:41,093 --> 00:02:42,526  X1:248 X2:467 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Come on.
- There you go.
00:02:48,773 --> 00:02:51,890  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:052 Y2:131
I did it!
One mile on a Hippity Hop.
00:02:52,493 --> 00:02:55,530  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:052 Y2:127
That's everything I wanted to do
before I was 30.
00:02:55,773 --> 00:02:58,492  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:052 Y2:131
Except I wanted to
patch things up with my sister.
00:02:58,733 --> 00:02:59,848  X1:208 X2:507 Y1:052 Y2:093
Oh, well. But, yeah!
00:03:01,773 --> 00:03:05,288  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:052 Y2:131
Girls, this thing is a godsend,
if you know what I mean.
00:03:14,613 --> 00:03:17,685  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:444 Y2:524
Let's have some fun.
What do you want to do?
00:03:17,973 --> 00:03:19,645  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:482 Y2:524
I don't want to do anything.
00:03:19,853 --> 00:03:24,608  X1:085 X2:629 Y1:052 Y2:131
Doing nothing on your 30th is better
than doing something stupid, like Ross.
00:03:25,453 --> 00:03:27,569  X1:142 X2:572 Y1:052 Y2:093
That was a practical purchase.
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:30,412  X1:110 X2:606 Y1:052 Y2:093
I needed that car for transportation.
00:03:30,653 --> 00:03:32,928  X1:202 X2:513 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay? I have a child.
00:03:33,493 --> 00:03:35,563  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:488 Y2:524
How hot do I look in this?
00:03:37,213 --> 00:03:38,692  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:484 Y2:524
Ross, a sports car?
00:03:38,893 --> 00:03:42,090  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:444 Y2:524
Wouldn't it be cheaper
to just stuff a sock down there?
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:44,889  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:488 Y2:524
That's not what this is about.
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:47,283  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:484 Y2:524
I am a sports car enthusiast.
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:51,082  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:444 Y2:524
- I've always been into cars.
- What's the horsepower?
00:03:51,573 --> 00:03:53,768  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:482 Y2:524
I don't know, but look how shiny!
00:03:56,053 --> 00:03:59,682  X1:135 X2:580 Y1:448 Y2:524
- I can't believe you bought this.
- So can I have a ride, stud?
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,292  X1:297 X2:418 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hop in.
00:04:02,573 --> 00:04:06,043  X1:166 X2:548 Y1:446 Y2:524
Get ready for the
smoothest ride of your life.
00:04:29,373 --> 00:04:30,692  X1:289 X2:426 Y1:488 Y2:524
Damn it.
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:34,291  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, who's next?
00:04:37,093 --> 00:04:41,371  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:446 Y2:524
I am gonna do something today. I
won't sit around like some old lady.
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,848  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:484 Y2:524
I want to get something pierced.
00:04:44,053 --> 00:04:47,250  X1:073 X2:643 Y1:484 Y2:524
Like my nose or my tongue or something.
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,091  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:484 Y2:524
Really? Because that hurts.
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:51,091  X1:228 X2:488 Y1:446 Y2:524
So what?
The way I see it...
00:04:51,293 --> 00:04:52,692  X1:246 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:524
Son of a bitch!
00:04:54,573 --> 00:04:57,087  X1:202 X2:513 Y1:446 Y2:524
Look, I know what
you're going through.
00:04:57,293 --> 00:05:00,410  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm totally freaked out
about turning 25.
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:05,530  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:484 Y2:524
Get out of my apartment.
00:05:06,493 --> 00:05:08,882  X1:101 X2:614 Y1:482 Y2:524
Rach, I think that you're doing great.
00:05:09,133 --> 00:05:11,806  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:450 Y2:524
Let's face it,
no one handles this well.
00:05:12,173 --> 00:05:13,845  X1:239 X2:477 Y1:484 Y2:524
Least of all you.
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:21,813  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:446 Y2:524
Put that back on.
Monica will be here any minute.
00:05:22,013 --> 00:05:24,083  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:482 Y2:524
But it hurts my Joey's apple.
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:31,044  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:450 Y2:524
For the last time, it's not named
after each individual man.
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:38,446  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:524
You've done a wonderful job with
the party. Everything's so lovely.
00:05:38,653 --> 00:05:40,132  X1:169 X2:545 Y1:484 Y2:524
Well, not as lovely as you.
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:43,683  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:524
I can't believe you have a
00:05:43,893 --> 00:05:47,568  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:444 Y2:524
And I can't believe you have
a tux that's 30 years old.
00:05:48,373 --> 00:05:52,730  X1:128 X2:586 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's older than that. Ross was
conceived right near this tuxedo.
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:57,644  X1:240 X2:475 Y1:446 Y2:524
Everybody hide!
She's coming.
00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:00,285  X1:232 X2:484 Y1:484 Y2:524
Everybody down!
00:06:05,813 --> 00:06:09,203  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:446 Y2:524
Everybody stay here.
I'll find out what's going on.
00:06:11,173 --> 00:06:13,846  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, you got the door open!
00:06:15,573 --> 00:06:17,643  X1:213 X2:505 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, are you drunk?
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:19,048  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
No.
00:06:21,293 --> 00:06:22,408  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay.
00:06:26,493 --> 00:06:27,812  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay.
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:32,330  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:446 Y2:524
See, I was a little nervous
about turning...
00:06:32,573 --> 00:06:33,892  X1:308 X2:408 Y1:488 Y2:524
...30.
00:06:34,733 --> 00:06:37,725  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:450 Y2:524
So the busboys took me out
for some drinks.
00:06:40,813 --> 00:06:43,327  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:484 Y2:524
Might want to puke on you later.
00:06:44,813 --> 00:06:49,523  X1:107 X2:607 Y1:444 Y2:524
Here's the thing. We've thrown
a very formal surprise party for you.
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:52,531  X1:094 X2:621 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Your parents and friends are in there.
- No!
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:53,722  X1:272 X2:443 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Yes! Yes!
- No.
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:57,005  X1:137 X2:582 Y1:450 Y2:524
Oh, no! My parents have never
seen me drunk.
00:06:57,413 --> 00:06:58,687  X1:218 X2:496 Y1:484 Y2:524
That they know of.
00:06:59,613 --> 00:07:03,652  X1:096 X2:618 Y1:444 Y2:524
We'll get you some coffee.
They'll never know that you're drunk.
00:07:03,853 --> 00:07:06,242  X1:222 X2:494 Y1:450 Y2:524
- You promise?
- I'll take care of it.
00:07:06,453 --> 00:07:08,409  X1:215 X2:500 Y1:484 Y2:524
I love you so much.
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:12,521  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:446 Y2:524
Okay, we have to do something
about your breath.
00:07:13,413 --> 00:07:15,688  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:484 Y2:524
What about your breath?
00:07:16,693 --> 00:07:18,649  X1:229 X2:485 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's still yours.
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:23,086  X1:211 X2:503 Y1:446 Y2:524
Now remember,
it's a surprise party.
00:07:23,293 --> 00:07:25,523  X1:121 X2:593 Y1:484 Y2:524
So when you go in, act surprised.
00:07:26,893 --> 00:07:28,008  X1:298 X2:420 Y1:484 Y2:524
Ready?
00:07:35,013 --> 00:07:36,241  X1:285 X2:429 Y1:484 Y2:524
Surprise!
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:43,805  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, forward. Forward.
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:45,128  X1:308 X2:406 Y1:484 Y2:524
Stop!
00:07:46,613 --> 00:07:48,126  X1:216 X2:499 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, back... Stop!
00:07:50,013 --> 00:07:51,332  X1:229 X2:487 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, for... Stop!
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:53,046  X1:263 X2:451 Y1:484 Y2:524
Stop! Stop!
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:56,323  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.
00:07:56,573 --> 00:07:59,212  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'll break into this minivan,
put it in neutral.
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:02,132  X1:131 X2:583 Y1:446 Y2:524
You push it forward
so Ross can get out of the spot.
00:08:03,373 --> 00:08:05,091  X1:197 X2:517 Y1:484 Y2:524
All right. Here we go.
00:08:11,093 --> 00:08:12,287  X1:284 X2:431 Y1:488 Y2:524
Haul ass!
00:08:23,493 --> 00:08:25,882  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:484 Y2:524
Happy 30th birthday! Here.
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,806  X1:189 X2:526 Y1:450 Y2:524
It's for the child in you.
And the woman.
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:31,682  X1:264 X2:452 Y1:484 Y2:524
Happy 30th!
00:08:31,893 --> 00:08:33,611  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why do you keep saying that?
00:08:33,933 --> 00:08:36,163  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:482 Y2:524
Because it's our 30th birthday.
00:08:36,373 --> 00:08:39,604  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:444 Y2:524
Yeah, no, we're not 30.
We're 31. Okay.
00:08:40,413 --> 00:08:41,732  X1:309 X2:406 Y1:488 Y2:524
Wait.
00:08:43,693 --> 00:08:45,206  X1:262 X2:453 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, it's you.
00:08:45,413 --> 00:08:47,051  X1:255 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yeah. What?
00:08:47,253 --> 00:08:49,209  X1:136 X2:578 Y1:486 Y2:524
Yeah, we're not 30. We're 31.
00:08:50,813 --> 00:08:53,202  X1:194 X2:520 Y1:444 Y2:524
That's what it says
on my birth certificate.
00:08:53,413 --> 00:08:54,926  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:524
You have a birth certificate?
00:08:55,173 --> 00:08:57,926  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:446 Y2:524
I got a big box of family stuff
when my mom died.
00:08:58,573 --> 00:08:59,403  X1:280 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:524
Our mom.
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,122  X1:258 X2:457 Y1:484 Y2:524
Right. Okay.
00:09:02,813 --> 00:09:06,726  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Do you have mine?
- No, I sold it to a Swedish runaway.
00:09:09,373 --> 00:09:10,726  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God.
00:09:11,613 --> 00:09:13,649  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God, we are 31!
00:09:13,893 --> 00:09:15,326  X1:306 X2:408 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yeah.
00:09:16,293 --> 00:09:19,012  X1:123 X2:592 Y1:484 Y2:524
I just lost a whole year of my life.
00:09:19,253 --> 00:09:20,447  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay.
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:24,287  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Your middle name is Pamela?
- Yes.
00:09:24,493 --> 00:09:27,405  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:446 Y2:524
I never knew mine.
Do you remember what it is?
00:09:27,653 --> 00:09:28,563  X1:315 X2:400 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yes.
00:09:28,813 --> 00:09:29,643  X1:292 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:524
Phoebe.
00:09:30,853 --> 00:09:34,482  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:444 Y2:524
- That's my first name.
- Right. Okay. Then, no.
00:09:38,093 --> 00:09:40,846  X1:154 X2:560 Y1:446 Y2:524
We made it across the room.
You're doing great.
00:09:41,253 --> 00:09:42,288  X1:229 X2:488 Y1:482 Y2:524
What's going on?
00:09:42,493 --> 00:09:44,006  X1:194 X2:522 Y1:488 Y2:524
Monica's a little drunk.
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:46,249  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yeah! I love drunk Monica.
00:09:47,733 --> 00:09:50,805  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:444 Y2:524
Oh, she's so much more fun
than regular Monica.
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,929  X1:087 X2:628 Y1:482 Y2:524
She doesn't want her parents to know.
00:09:56,493 --> 00:09:59,371  X1:204 X2:512 Y1:450 Y2:524
All right, all right.
Here's what we'll do.
00:09:59,573 --> 00:10:03,361  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:450 Y2:524
I'll get twice as drunk,
then no one will even notice her.
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:08,972  X1:229 X2:488 Y1:482 Y2:524
What's going on?
00:10:09,853 --> 00:10:11,002  X1:229 X2:486 Y1:488 Y2:524
Monica's wasted.
00:10:11,213 --> 00:10:13,681  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:524
Maybe that'll liven up this party.
00:10:14,373 --> 00:10:16,648  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:484 Y2:524
Will you just help her get changed?
00:10:16,973 --> 00:10:20,170  X1:096 X2:621 Y1:446 Y2:524
Taking care of a drunk, naked woman
seems like a job for Joey.
00:10:24,973 --> 00:10:26,804  X1:212 X2:502 Y1:488 Y2:524
This one's from me.
00:10:27,053 --> 00:10:29,567  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:444 Y2:524
It wasn't on your list,
but it's really fun.
00:10:31,253 --> 00:10:32,845  X1:275 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:524
A scooter.
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,603  X1:238 X2:476 Y1:488 Y2:524
Stick to the list.
00:10:38,173 --> 00:10:41,131  X1:188 X2:526 Y1:484 Y2:524
Always stick to the list.
00:10:41,813 --> 00:10:44,122  X1:154 X2:562 Y1:484 Y2:524
No, no, I love it. Thank you.
00:10:45,093 --> 00:10:47,004  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:484 Y2:524
Open ours next! Open ours next!
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,602  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:444 Y2:524
Now that you're a couple,
we don't get two gifts?
00:10:49,813 --> 00:10:52,805  X1:209 X2:507 Y1:446 Y2:524
For my last birthday,
you gave me a hug.
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,689  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:488 Y2:524
Read the card! Read the card!
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,563  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:482 Y2:524
"Happy birthday, Grandma.
00:11:03,773 --> 00:11:06,367  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:524
It's better to be over the hill...
00:11:07,013 --> 00:11:09,049  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:488 Y2:524
...than buried under it.
00:11:12,053 --> 00:11:14,965  X1:110 X2:605 Y1:444 Y2:524
All our love, Monica and Chandler. "
That's funny.
00:11:15,213 --> 00:11:17,488  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:484 Y2:524
No, no. That was a joke.
00:11:17,693 --> 00:11:20,366  X1:165 X2:551 Y1:482 Y2:524
I know, I get it. It's funny.
00:11:20,573 --> 00:11:22,450  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:482 Y2:524
Because you're not a grandma.
00:11:22,653 --> 00:11:26,043  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:450 Y2:524
To be a grandma, you have to
be married and have children.
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:30,565  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't have any of those things.
That's why it's so funny.
00:11:31,133 --> 00:11:32,486  X1:210 X2:506 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm just gonna go... .
00:11:36,853 --> 00:11:39,572  X1:107 X2:607 Y1:484 Y2:524
All you had to do was buy the card.
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:49,721  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:446 Y2:524
It was stupid to get upset about
not having a husband and kids.
00:11:49,973 --> 00:11:52,123  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:484 Y2:524
All I really needed was a plan.
00:11:52,573 --> 00:11:54,245  X1:194 X2:520 Y1:486 Y2:524
See, I want three kids.
00:11:54,493 --> 00:11:59,283  X1:099 X2:618 Y1:446 Y2:524
And you want to have them all at the
same time and all for your brother.
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,691  X1:220 X2:495 Y1:484 Y2:524
As I was saying... .
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:06,284  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:446 Y2:524
I should have the first one
by the time I'm 35.
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:08,529  X1:167 X2:547 Y1:484 Y2:524
Which gives me five years.
00:12:09,213 --> 00:12:13,206  X1:112 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:524
If I want a kid when I'm 35, I don't
have to get pregnant until I'm 34.
00:12:13,453 --> 00:12:17,002  X1:123 X2:592 Y1:446 Y2:524
Which gives Prada four years
to start making maternity clothes.
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:23,448  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:446 Y2:524
But I want to be married
for a year before I get pregnant.
00:12:23,813 --> 00:12:25,644  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:484 Y2:524
Really? That long?
00:12:30,293 --> 00:12:33,126  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:482 Y2:524
Look all you want, it's happening.
00:12:35,893 --> 00:12:39,852  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't have to get married until
I'm 33. That's three whole years.
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,287  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:484 Y2:524
Wait a minute, though.
00:12:41,533 --> 00:12:44,969  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'll need a year and a half
to plan the wedding.
00:12:45,213 --> 00:12:48,046  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:444 Y2:524
And I'd like to know the guy
for a year, year and a half...
00:12:48,293 --> 00:12:50,363  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:484 Y2:524
...before we get engaged.
00:12:51,253 --> 00:12:55,326  X1:103 X2:615 Y1:446 Y2:524
Which means I need to meet the guy
by the time I'm 30.
00:12:56,613 --> 00:13:00,447  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:446 Y2:524
Which is fine
because you just turned...
00:13:00,693 --> 00:13:02,331  X1:308 X2:408 Y1:488 Y2:524
...28!
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,483  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:486 Y2:524
No, Ross. No, it is not fine.
00:13:05,693 --> 00:13:09,083  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:446 Y2:524
I should already be with
the guy I'm gonna marry.
00:13:15,813 --> 00:13:17,724  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:484 Y2:524
Will you quit hogging it?
00:13:22,693 --> 00:13:26,447  X1:113 X2:601 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm telling you, it's like
watching Bambi learn how to walk.
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,326  X1:254 X2:460 Y1:488 Y2:524
You're drunk.
00:13:30,693 --> 00:13:33,082  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:484 Y2:524
Mom and Dad are gonna be mad.
00:13:35,213 --> 00:13:37,010  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:482 Y2:524
Maybe I'm a little drunk.
00:13:39,613 --> 00:13:40,841  X1:198 X2:518 Y1:488 Y2:524
Are those crab cakes?
00:13:41,093 --> 00:13:44,642  X1:129 X2:589 Y1:446 Y2:524
I told you to come straight to me
when they were ready.
00:13:46,813 --> 00:13:48,132  X1:232 X2:486 Y1:484 Y2:524
How you feeling?
00:13:49,053 --> 00:13:51,613  X1:198 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:524
You are so handsome.
00:13:53,493 --> 00:13:56,690  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:446 Y2:524
I want to make love to you
right here, right now.
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:02,052  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:482 Y2:524
I really wish that you wouldn't.
00:14:03,693 --> 00:14:08,209  X1:125 X2:589 Y1:446 Y2:524
Just get through a little bit more,
then we can put you in bed.
00:14:08,453 --> 00:14:12,332  X1:101 X2:612 Y1:482 Y2:524
Just smile, and don't talk to anyone.
00:14:13,013 --> 00:14:16,642  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:446 Y2:524
Speech, speech!
Let's hear from the birthday girl.
00:14:17,653 --> 00:14:18,642  X1:293 X2:422 Y1:488 Y2:524
Pheebs!
00:14:18,853 --> 00:14:20,764  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:482 Y2:524
See, everybody's looking at me.
00:14:20,973 --> 00:14:22,326  X1:214 X2:501 Y1:482 Y2:524
The plan's working.
00:14:23,493 --> 00:14:26,326  X1:209 X2:509 Y1:444 Y2:524
I didn't even have to
take off my top yet.
00:14:26,893 --> 00:14:28,690  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:484 Y2:524
Speech. Come on, speech!
00:14:32,173 --> 00:14:35,370  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:450 Y2:524
You can't keep your hands off her
for one second.
00:14:35,613 --> 00:14:37,092  X1:241 X2:474 Y1:488 Y2:524
I think it's nice.
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,170  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:482 Y2:524
I think it's necessary.
00:14:46,973 --> 00:14:49,692  X1:117 X2:599 Y1:484 Y2:524
I want to thank you all for coming.
00:14:50,133 --> 00:14:51,771  X1:238 X2:478 Y1:484 Y2:524
My family and...
00:14:52,013 --> 00:14:53,002  X1:257 X2:459 Y1:484 Y2:524
...my friends.
00:14:57,013 --> 00:14:59,527  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'd really like to say that I'm... .
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:04,086  X1:101 X2:616 Y1:482 Y2:524
You know what I'd really like to say?
00:15:04,813 --> 00:15:06,451  X1:277 X2:438 Y1:488 Y2:524
I'm drunk!
00:15:08,933 --> 00:15:10,730  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's right, Mom and Dad.
00:15:10,933 --> 00:15:14,164  X1:073 X2:641 Y1:488 Y2:524
Your little old "Harmomica" is hammered.
00:15:16,613 --> 00:15:17,568  X1:231 X2:486 Y1:484 Y2:524
And guess what?
00:15:17,813 --> 00:15:19,724  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:488 Y2:524
I've been drunk before.
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:22,922  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:482 Y2:524
And I've smoked a cigarette.
00:15:25,933 --> 00:15:28,493  X1:215 X2:501 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's all okay.
It's okay because...
00:15:28,733 --> 00:15:30,530  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:484 Y2:524
...I turned 30 today.
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:34,047  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:484 Y2:524
And I can do anything I want.
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:37,252  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:484 Y2:524
Because I am a grownup.
00:15:42,853 --> 00:15:45,447  X1:118 X2:598 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, quick. Help me get this off.
00:15:49,413 --> 00:15:50,812  X1:218 X2:497 Y1:484 Y2:524
I lost a whole year.
00:15:51,013 --> 00:15:53,527  X1:234 X2:482 Y1:450 Y2:524
I can't believe it.
This is so unfair!
00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:55,610  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:482 Y2:524
Come on, Pheebs, it'll be okay.
00:15:55,813 --> 00:15:57,041  X1:244 X2:472 Y1:488 Y2:524
Will it? Will it?
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,893  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:446 Y2:524
How would you feel if
you found out you were 31?
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:04,768  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:450 Y2:524
That's not gonna happen.
Because we have a new deal.
00:16:06,013 --> 00:16:08,049  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:484 Y2:524
Plus, it ruined my schedule.
00:16:08,253 --> 00:16:12,132  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:450 Y2:524
I haven't done the things
I wanted to do before I was 31.
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,129  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:524
Like what?
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:16,450  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:444 Y2:524
Like I haven't met
any Portuguese people.
00:16:16,693 --> 00:16:19,161  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:482 Y2:524
I haven't had the perfect kiss.
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:21,529  X1:105 X2:610 Y1:482 Y2:524
And I haven't been to sniper school.
00:16:23,493 --> 00:16:26,530  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:524
Why don't we go and
have some birthday cake?
00:16:26,893 --> 00:16:30,806  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:446 Y2:524
I just feel like being by myself.
See you guys later. Thanks.
00:16:32,893 --> 00:16:34,212  X1:259 X2:456 Y1:488 Y2:524
Poor Pheebs.
00:16:34,813 --> 00:16:38,203  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hey, you guys, I think
I'm gonna walk her home.
00:16:41,493 --> 00:16:43,927  X1:279 X2:436 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Oh, man.
- What?
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:46,044  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:482 Y2:524
He's gonna eat the cake.
00:16:47,813 --> 00:16:49,132  X1:293 X2:422 Y1:488 Y2:524
Pheebs!
00:16:49,573 --> 00:16:50,847  X1:272 X2:444 Y1:486 Y2:524
Listen, I... .
00:16:51,693 --> 00:16:52,728  X1:236 X2:480 Y1:484 Y2:524
Close your eyes.
00:17:05,373 --> 00:17:07,728  X1:218 X2:498 Y1:444 Y2:524
That's one thing to
cross off your list.
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:11,132  X1:281 X2:435 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, yeah.
00:17:13,093 --> 00:17:15,732  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:482 Y2:524
Plus, I'm one-sixteenth Portuguese.
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:21,809  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, is everybody clear?
00:17:22,013 --> 00:17:23,924  X1:179 X2:535 Y1:482 Y2:524
We're gonna pick it up...
00:17:25,973 --> 00:17:27,326  X1:249 X2:468 Y1:488 Y2:524
...and move it.
00:17:28,493 --> 00:17:32,771  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:446 Y2:524
All we need is teamwork.
We're gonna lift the car...
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:35,649  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:524
...and slide it out.
00:17:38,413 --> 00:17:39,562  X1:308 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:524
Lift...
00:17:39,813 --> 00:17:41,610  X1:267 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:524
...and slide.
00:17:42,093 --> 00:17:44,732  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Ross, I really don't think this...
- Lift...
00:17:45,813 --> 00:17:47,963  X1:267 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:524
...and slide.
00:17:48,253 --> 00:17:50,687  X1:214 X2:501 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Okay, here we go.
- All right, everyone.
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:52,491  X1:308 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:524
Lift...
00:17:56,173 --> 00:17:58,129  X1:267 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:524
...and slide.
00:18:02,093 --> 00:18:05,802  X1:096 X2:619 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Hey, Joey...
- Come on, Rach, my turn just started.
00:18:07,093 --> 00:18:09,129  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:484 Y2:524
Actually, I just want to talk to Tag.
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:12,211  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, okay.
Hey, can I ride this outside?
00:18:12,413 --> 00:18:14,404  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:482 Y2:524
Whatever. I'm not your mother.
00:18:15,373 --> 00:18:17,011  X1:233 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:524
Not in the street!
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:24,606  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Are you feeling any better?
- Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm... .
00:18:25,973 --> 00:18:27,201  X1:279 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:524
Let's talk.
00:18:29,373 --> 00:18:30,806  X1:269 X2:447 Y1:482 Y2:524
What's up?
00:18:31,053 --> 00:18:32,566  X1:272 X2:443 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, Tag... .
00:18:33,693 --> 00:18:37,049  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:444 Y2:524
You're such a great guy.
And we have so much fun together.
00:18:37,253 --> 00:18:38,447  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:450 Y2:524
- But l...
- Wait.
00:18:39,373 --> 00:18:41,250  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:524
I think I see where you're going.
00:18:41,493 --> 00:18:45,008  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:446 Y2:524
Before you say anything else,
can I say one more thing?
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,492  X1:279 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:524
Well said.
00:18:56,773 --> 00:18:59,890  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:446 Y2:524
And a good example of the fun
I was referring to.
00:19:01,213 --> 00:19:06,003  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:444 Y2:524
But I think I'm past the point
where I can just have fun.
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:09,603  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:444 Y2:524
Don't do this. This is just
because you're turning 30.
00:19:09,813 --> 00:19:11,246  X1:272 X2:442 Y1:486 Y2:524
Yeah, it is.
00:19:12,013 --> 00:19:15,130  X1:207 X2:509 Y1:444 Y2:524
But you're just a kid.
I mean, you're 25.
00:19:15,813 --> 00:19:18,008  X1:195 X2:520 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Twenty-four, actually.
- Oh, God.
00:19:20,413 --> 00:19:25,123  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:446 Y2:524
You know what I wish?
I wish you were six years older.
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:29,565  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:444 Y2:524
Well, if I'm wishing for stuff,
I wish I was six years younger.
00:19:30,573 --> 00:19:33,212  X1:253 X2:463 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Me too.
- Yeah. Sorry.
00:19:41,893 --> 00:19:43,167  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:482 Y2:524
Hey, how'd it go?
00:19:44,613 --> 00:19:49,004  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:446 Y2:524
If I only want two kids,
can I keep him for another year?
00:19:50,373 --> 00:19:52,125  X1:191 X2:523 Y1:484 Y2:524
You did the right thing.
00:19:56,493 --> 00:19:58,609  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:482 Y2:524
I don't like this anymore.
00:20:02,973 --> 00:20:06,329  X1:149 X2:565 Y1:446 Y2:524
Well, here we are.
Just a bunch of 30-year-olds.
00:20:07,493 --> 00:20:11,611  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:446 Y2:524
Do you realize in 10 years
we're gonna be 40?
00:20:14,853 --> 00:20:16,332  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why, God?
00:20:16,573 --> 00:20:19,087  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why are you doing this to us?
00:20:26,933 --> 00:20:29,845  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:052 Y2:094
Yes! My baby's finally free.
00:20:30,053 --> 00:20:31,327  X1:287 X2:428 Y1:052 Y2:093
All right!
00:20:32,093 --> 00:20:33,890  X1:204 X2:510 Y1:052 Y2:094
Start it up. Let's go!
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,012  X1:233 X2:484 Y1:052 Y2:088
How hot are we?
00:20:51,493 --> 00:20:53,370  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:052 Y2:093
You want to buy a car?
