00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:08,773
These were unbelievely expensive
and he'll grow out of them...
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,705
...in 20 minutes,
but I couldn't resist!
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:17,550
Look at these.
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:18,883
Hey, Ben.
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,746
"Just do it"!
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:24,184
Oh, my God!
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:26,415
Was that too much
pressure for him?
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:31,459
- Is he hungry already?
- I guess so.
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:34,157
You know, it's...
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:40,195
Something funny about sneakers.
I'll be right back.
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:43,169
I gotta get one too.
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:47,743
Hey, what are you guys doing?
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:50,447
We're just hanging out
by the spoons.
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:52,516
Ladle?
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:53,946
Will you guys grow up?
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,951
This is the most nature beautiful
thing in the world.
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:00,192
Yeah, we know.
But there's a baby sucking on it.
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:07,526
This is my son having lunch, okay?
It'll happen a lot, so get used to it.
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,401
If you're uncomfortable,
just ask questions.
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:13,298
Carol's fine with it.
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:17,138
Carol?
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:23,775
I'm wondering, could Joey ask you
a question about breast-feeding?
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:27,218
Sure.
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,155
Does it hurt?
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,927
It did at first, but not anymore.
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:36,385
Chandler?
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:41,333
So, how often can you do it?
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,400
As much as he needs.
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,695
Okay, I got one, I got one.
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:52,068
If he blows into one,
does the other one get bigger?
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:59,875
The One With the Breast Milk
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:45,193
- Any muffins left?
- Yeah, I forget which ones.
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,396
You're busy, I'll get it.
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:50,328
- Anyone else want one?
- No, thanks.
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:53,037
You're losing your apron.
Let me get it.
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:56,007
- There you go.
- Thank you.
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,540
What a bitch!
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:06,008
I have a friend at
Bloomingdale's who's quitting...
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:08,481
...and he wants to abuse his discount.
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:11,019
Anyone want to come
take advantage of it?
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,885
I have to take
my grandmother to the vet.
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,326
- I'll go with you.
- Great.
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,098
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, sweetums.
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,401
And hello to the rest.
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:34,806
You can't go shopping with her.
What about Rachel?
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:36,942
Will it be a problem?
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:39,242
You're going to
Bloomingdale's with Julie.
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:42,977
It's like cheating on Rachel
in her house of worship.
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,116
Monica, she will kill you.
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:50,489
She will kill you
like a dog in the street!
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:58,696
So Jules tells me you guys
are going shopping tomorrow.
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,932
It's actually not that big a deal.
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,267
It's a big deal to me.
This is great.
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,545
I really appreciate this.
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,280
You're welcome.
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,357
Bijan for men?
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,060
Bijan for men?
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:32,430
- Hey, Annabel.
- Hey, Joey.
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:34,798
Did you hear about the new guy?
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:39,477
Nobody knows his name. Me and
the girls call him "The Hombre Man."
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:50,286
Hombre?
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,426
What's he doing in my section?
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,325
I guess he doesn't know.
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,190
Well, he's gonna.
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,293
I'll see you a little later, okay?
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,097
Hey, how you doing?
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:10,574
Mornin'.
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,378
Listen, I know you're new...
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,876
...but it's understood
that everything...
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:20,519
...from young men's to
the escalator is my territory.
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:24,246
"Your territory"?
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,286
- Bijan for men?
- No, thanks.
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:28,892
Hombre?
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:31,355
Yeah, all right.
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:39,195
You were saying?
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:47,178
Phoebe, listen. You were with me,
and we were shopping all day.
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:49,705
We shopped and we had lunch.
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,108
What did I have?
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,116
- You had a salad.
- No wonder I don't feel full.
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:57,448
Hi. What's up?
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,625
I went shopping with Monica
and I had a salad.
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:05,090
Good, Pheebs.
What'd you buy?
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,032
We went shopping for...
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:10,627
For...
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,833
For fur.
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,968
You went shopping for fur?
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:21,706
And then I realized
that I'm against that.
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,243
So then we bought some...
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:27,778
Boobs.
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:34,591
You bought boobs?
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,388
Bras!
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:41,358
We bought bras!
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,529
We bought bras.
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:49,004
Bijan for men?
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,136
Bijan for men?
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,776
Bijan for...
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:55,738
Hey, Annabel.
00:06:56,182 --> 00:07:00,084
I was wondering if after work
we could grab a cup of coffee?
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,654
Actually, I sort of have plans.
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,552
You ready, Annabel?
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,363
You bet.
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,395
Maybe some other time.
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:30,105
It's not the first time I lost a girl
to a cowboy spraying cologne.
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,849
Bijan for men?
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:33,910
Bijan for men!
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,353
And this is Funny Clown.
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,026
It's only for after his naps,
not before, or he won't sleep.
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,695
We've been through this before.
We have a good time.
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:48,229
We laugh, we play.
It's like we're father and son.
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:53,128
Honey, relax.
Ross is great with him.
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:57,274
Don't look so surprised.
I'm a lovely person.
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:01,074
This is so cute!
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:02,905
I got that for him!
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:04,683
"My Mommies Love Me."
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,145
That's clever.
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,487
Oh, hi, Jul...
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,328
Hi, Jew!
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,428
Okay, sure.
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:26,599
That'd be great.
See you then. Bye.
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,098
Did you just say, "Hi, Jew"?
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,636
Yes, I did.
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,941
That was my friend Eddie Moskowitz.
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,290
Yeah, he likes it.
Reaffirms his faith.
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,702
Ben, dinner!
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,036
Thanks, Aunt Pheebs.
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:02,741
Did you microwave that?
You can't do that to breast milk.
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,876
I think I know
how to heat breast milk.
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,708
What did you just do?
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,713
I licked my arm, what?
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:16,148
It's breast milk!
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:17,649
So?
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:21,121
Phoebe, that is juice
squeezed from a person.
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,819
What is the big deal?
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,797
What did you just do?
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:34,304
Can people stop
drinking the breast milk?
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,500
You won't even taste it?
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:41,138
Not even if you just
pretend it's milk?
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:45,608
Not even if Carol's breast had
a picture of a missing child on it.
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:56,759
- Where is everybody?
- At the park. Where have you been?
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,330
Just out.
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:02,864
Had some lunch. Just me.
A little quality time with me.
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:05,965
- Thanks for your jacket.
- No problem.
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,037
You can borrow it, by the way.
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,107
Here are your keys, honey.
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,915
If you were at lunch alone,
how come it cost you $53?
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,223
You know what probably happened?
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,419
Someone stole my credit card.
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,758
And put the receipt
back in your pocket?
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:36,330
That is an excellent,
excellent question.
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,168
That is excellent.
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:42,405
What's with you?
Who did you have lunch with?
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:43,936
- Judy.
- Who?
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,177
- Julie.
- What?
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:46,775
Jody.
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,778
You were with Julie?
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:54,710
When it started, I was just
trying to be nice to her...
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,581
...because she was
my brother's girlfriend.
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:01,221
And then one thing
led to another...
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:04,362
...and before I knew it, we were...
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,364
...shopping.
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:12,235
Oh, my God!
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:16,304
Wait, we only did it once.
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,069
It didn't meant anything to me!
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:26,447
Rachal, I was thinking
of you the whole time.
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:33,618
Look, I'm sorry, all right?
I never meant for you to find out.
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,522
Oh, please! Please!
You wanted to get caught!
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,257
That is not true!
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,000
So you just happened
to leave it in here?
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:46,732
Did it ever occur to you
that I might just be that stupid?
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,938
Okay, I just have to know one thing.
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,839
Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's?
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:14,891
Okay, I just really need
to not be with you right now.
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:26,802
Hi, who's this?
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:30,171
Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working?
It's Monica.
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,478
Yes, I know I did a horrible thing.
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:36,613
Joanne, it's not
as simple as all that.
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:42,092
No, I don't care what Steve thinks.
Hi, Steve.
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:48,626
How did we do?
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,528
I tasted Ben's milk
and Ross freaked out.
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:53,531
I did not freak out.
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:57,003
- Why'd you freak out?
- Because it's breast milk.
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:58,940
It's gross!
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,412
My breast milk is gross?
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:05,249
This should be fun.
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,015
There's nothing wrong with it.
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:12,918
I just don't think
breast milk is for adults.
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:16,456
Of course, the packaging does
appeal to grownups and kids.
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:21,631
Don't be silly. I've tried it.
It's no big deal.
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:22,798
Just taste it.
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,434
That would be no.
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:28,328
- Come on.
- Try it.
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,471
It's natural.
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,039
It doesn't taste bad.
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:34,176
Yeah, it tastes kind of sweet.
Sort of like...
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:35,209
Like what?
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,470
Cantaloupe juice.
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,080
Exactly.
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,814
You've tasted it.
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:48,993
You've tasted it.
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,127
Oh, you've tasted it.
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:58,236
You can keep saying it,
but it won't stop being true.
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,576
Give me the bottle.
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,852
Get me the towel.
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:40,968
Howdy.
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,316
Give me a box of juice.
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:50,051
Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:53,287
Maybe it's because of
the way you're dressed.
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,355
Or this guy's doing so good
they want to put more people on it.
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:01,932
This guy goes through
two bottles a day now.
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,703
What do you care?
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,802
You're an actor.
This is your day job. It's nothing!
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,543
I know, but I was the best.
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:15,871
You know? I liked being the best.
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,579
Maybe I should get
out of the game.
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:26,253
They need guys up in housewares
to serve cheese.
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:27,584
Say you do that.
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:31,887
Sooner or later, somebody will come
along that slices a better cheddar.
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,523
Then where you gonna run?
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:36,800
You're right.
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:40,369
I say you show him what you're made of.
Stand your ground.
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:45,201
Show him that you're the baddest
Hombre west of the lingerie!
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,002
- I'm gonna do it!
- All right!
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:52,812
Now, go see Miss Kitty and
she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,611
I don't know what to say.
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,220
That's good because I'm not listening.
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,722
I feel terrible. I really do.
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,225
I'm sorry.
Did my back hurt your knife?
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:11,425
Say that I'm friends with her.
Is that so terrible?
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,939
- It's that terrible?
- You don't get it!
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,902
It's bad enough
she stole the guy...
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,667
...who may be the person
I'm supposed to be with.
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,112
But now...
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,015
...she's actually...
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,578
But now she's actually stealing you!
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,120
What are you talking about?
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:35,823
Nobody could steal me from you.
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:40,464
Because I'm friends with her doesn't
make me any less friends with you.
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,333
You're my...
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,401
And we're...
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:52,441
- Oh, I love you!
- I love you too!
00:16:56,915 --> 00:17:01,852
You guys, I know that this really
doesn't have anything to do with me.
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:03,645
But I love you guys too!
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:11,788
I really needed that.
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:15,633
I know that right now...
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:18,459
...you really need
to hate Julie's guts.
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,502
But she didn't do anything wrong.
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:26,110
She's just a girl who met a guy,
and now they go out.
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,848
I think that if you gave her
a chance, you'd like her.
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,976
Will you give it a chance?
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,149
For me?
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:40,516
I'd do anything for you,
you know that.
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,661
I'd do anything for you!
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,291
Wait, wait, wait!
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:05,746
Mornin'.
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,118
I said, mornin'!
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:13,750
I heard you.
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:18,455
All right, everybody.
I'm opening the doors.
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,059
You boys ready?
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:26,333
Ready.
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,503
Yeah, I'm ready.
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:17,584
You idiot! You stupid cowboy!
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:19,991
You've blinded me! I'm suing!
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:23,820
Oh, my God! Todd!
What the hell did you do?
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,887
Sorry. I'm such a doofus!
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:28,496
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,362
My God, what happened?
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:34,803
These new kids, they never last.
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:37,473
Sooner or later they all...
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,872
...stop lasting.
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:44,070
What do you say I buy you
that cup of coffee now?
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,517
Sure.
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,134
I just thought we should hang out.
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,239
I mean, you know,
we've never really talked.
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:13,569
I guess you'd know that,
being one of the two of us.
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,302
I know.
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:19,279
I probably shouldn't
even tell you this...
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:22,612
...but I'm pretty much
totally intimidated by you.
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:24,756
Really?
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,046
Me?
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,156
Oh, my God, are you kidding?
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,155
Ross is so crazy about you...
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,523
...and I really wanted you
to like me, and I...
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:36,665
It's probably me just
being totally paranoid...
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,394
...but I kind of got the feeling
that maybe you don't.
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:51,544
Well, you're not totally paranoid.
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,630
When you and Ross
first started going out...
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,128
...it was really hard for me...
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:16,435
...for many reasons of which
I'm not gonna bore you with now.
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,783
I see how happy he is
and how good you guys are together.
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:31,012
And Monica's always
saying how nice you are...
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,485
...and God, I hate it when she's right!
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,060
Thanks.
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:41,257
Would you like to go to
a movie sometime or something?
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,430
Yeah, that'd be great.
I'd love it.
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:46,398
I'd love it too.
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,734
Shoot, I gotta go.
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,909
- So I'll talk to you later.
- All right, Julie.
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:03,186
What a manipulative bitch.
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:35,282
It's not bad.
