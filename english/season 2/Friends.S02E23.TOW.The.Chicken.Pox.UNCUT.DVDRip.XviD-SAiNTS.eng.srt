00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:04,731
Chandler, Mon, there's only
one banana-nut muffin left.
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:06,097
I ordered mine first.
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:08,397
Yeah, but I'm so much faster.
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:10,774
Give it to me.
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:12,073
No.
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:13,872
Give it to me!
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:16,442
Okay, you can have it.
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:26,449
There you go. Enjoy your coffee.
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:30,191
That was there when I got here.
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:35,924
Hey, you'll never guess
who's coming to New York.
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:38,794
Quick, tell us before he swallows.
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:41,933
Ryan, that guy I dated
who's in the Navy.
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:45,102
You went out with a guy in the Navy?
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:47,779
I met him while playing guitar
in the park.
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:51,279
Ryan threw in saltwater taffy
because he didn't have change.
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:54,578
Is that when you wrote
"Saltwater Taffy Man"?
00:00:56,523 --> 00:01:00,254
No, he's my submarine guy.
He resurfaces every couple years...
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:03,121
...and we have an amazing
three days together.
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:08,130
Only this time, he's coming for 2 weeks.
Two whole weeks, which means "yea"!
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:12,862
So this guy goes down
for, like, two years at a time?
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,636
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:23,979
Hi.
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:26,579
Oh, no. What happened?
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,254
I just spoke to Carol.
Ben's got chickenpox.
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:30,456
Oh, no.
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,989
Yeah, so if you haven't had it,
chances are you'll get it.
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:35,922
- I've had it.
- I've had it.
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:37,129
- Had it.
- Had it.
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:40,696
I've never had it. I feel so left out.
Oh, look!
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:49,873
The One With the Chicken Pox
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:36,815
Honey, you made the bed again.
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,354
I told you, you don't have to do that.
This isn't camp.
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:44,654
Then I guess the panty raid last night
was totally uncalled for.
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:50,861
I'm taking a shower. Today I'll
sing Jim Croce's "Leroy Brown."
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,177
Hey, Mon, I have a question.
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:08,619
Is Leroy the baddest man
in the whole damn town...
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,823
...or the fattest man?
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:15,954
The baddest. Otherwise, the song
would be "Fat, Fat Leroy Brown."
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:17,730
What are you doing?
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,533
I'm just waiting for you, sweetie.
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,165
Are you remaking the bed?
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:31,035
I'm sorry. The way you did it,
it was just fine.
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,675
Then you're redoing it
because...?
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,572
You'll think I'm crazy.
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,544
You're pretty much
running that risk either way.
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:41,977
Okay. You see...
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,891
...the duvet tag shouldn't be
at the top left corner...
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,650
...it should be at the
bottom right corner.
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:52,096
- That's not so crazy.
- I'm just easing you in.
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:53,864
All right.
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:56,860
You see these little flower blossoms?
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:59,071
They should be facing up not down...
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:02,934
...because the head of the bed
is where the sun would be.
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,746
You don't love me anymore, do you?
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:14,044
Actually, if it's possible,
I love you more.
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,550
Really?
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,625
Wow. Well, then, come on!
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,190
I wanna show you how to fold
the toilet paper into a point.
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,600
If you need something
to hold you over...
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,769
...I can get you a job here
as an entry-level processor.
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,836
Don't you need experience like this?
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,405
It's not hard to learn.
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:40,406
As for people realizing you don't know
what you're doing, you're an actor.
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:44,139
Act like a processor,
people will think you're a processor.
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:47,816
Here's this morning's projections.
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,579
Thanks.
Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbiani.
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,684
Joey is a fellow processor.
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,486
No kidding?
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:03,267
I process. People want the processing,
I'm the one they call.
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,868
- Where do you work?
- Well, I'm in between things.
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:11,473
You know, one day you're processing,
the next day...
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,939
...you're not so much
processing anymore.
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:17,081
I told Joey about the opening
in Fleischman's group.
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,909
Fleischman's group.
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,280
Whatever you do,
don't touch his sandwiches.
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,619
Are all you processors dorks?
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:36,293
This lipstick looks just great on you.
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:39,070
You look fabulous.
You really do.
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,897
Yeah, are you sure?
Really?
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:47,171
See, you look beautiful.
For God sakes, dim the lights.
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:50,915
I'm hideous!
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,481
It's gonna be okay.
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:54,275
Ryan's been underwater.
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,081
He's just gonna be glad you don't
have barnacles on your butt.
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:11,635
Come in.
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,629
Hey, baby, I'm back
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,774
Hey, Ryan. What's up?
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:20,634
What's going on?
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,644
No, no.
You have to stay back.
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,181
I have the pox!
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,851
Chicken or small?
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,857
Chicken, which is so ironic
considering I'm a vegetarian.
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:38,953
- Why aren't you home in bed?
- My grandmother's never had chickenpox.
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:43,802
Please tell me you have, because
oh, my God, I forgot how cute you are.
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,804
I'm sorry, I never had them.
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,810
If I had one wish,
I'd go back to when I was 7...
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:57,812
...when Jimmy Hauser had chickenpox,
and rub that kid all over my face.
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:01,143
Yeah, or you could wish
that I didn't have them now.
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:03,282
Can I please see your face?
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:06,321
No. You don't wanna see a face
covered with pox.
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,720
It could be lox, I wouldn't care.
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:11,787
And you hate fish.
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,595
So sweet. All right.
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:18,063
Okay, all right.
You can see.
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,835
This is me.
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:26,870
Sorry!
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,008
I am scary!
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:31,842
The lightening was
an unfortunate coincidence.
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,820
You look lovely!
Lovely!
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:37,181
I hate this.
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,816
I had the most amazing
two weeks planned for us.
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,518
And everything I had in mind,
we had to be a lot closer than this.
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:50,095
I've spent the last eight months
in a steel tube with men...
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,931
...thinking about this moment.
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:57,075
I am not gonna let a bunch...
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,540
...of itchy spots stand between us.
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:10,377
Okay. This is the most
romantic disease I've ever had.
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,791
- How's the first day?
- Good. It's like you said.
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:22,967
It's putting numbers
from one column into another.
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,293
There you go.
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:29,065
And everybody's nice. I just had
a good talk with that lady Jeannie.
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,967
Jeannie? The head of
East Coast operations, Jeannie?
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:35,646
Turns out our kids go
to the same school.
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,648
Yeah. Small world, huh?
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,216
Weird world.
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,288
Your kids?
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,125
I figure my character has kids.
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:52,726
There isn't a part of that sentence
I don't need explained.
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:56,925
When you're acting, you need
to think about that stuff.
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:59,501
My character,
Joseph the processing guy...
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:03,801
...has two little girls,
Ashley and Brittany.
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:07,605
Ashley copies everything
Brittany does.
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:16,583
Well, invisible kids
can be that way sometimes.
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:22,494
You know, Joseph and his wife, Karen,
are thinking of having a third kid.
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:23,990
You know what?
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:25,922
Just did.
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:31,401
That's some pretty powerful
imaginary sperm you must have there.
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,548
You Know what makes the itching worse?
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,612
That you don't stop talking about it?
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:52,053
- Fine.
- Let's just play, okay?
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:53,588
Good, okay.
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,391
Here we go, double sixes.
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,620
Here we go...
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:00,955
Here we go...
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,294
Come to Mama.
Getting ready to roll the dice...
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:07,130
What are you doing?
Are you scratching?
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:10,171
No. This is what I do
for luck, okay?
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,642
You're scratching.
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,105
Give me the dice.
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,838
- Give me the dice.
- No! Here. There!
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,481
Look, double sixes!
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,314
We can't scratch. We'll scar.
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:26,418
I can't stop thinking about it.
It's just so hard.
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:29,957
I wanna grab these houses
and rub them all over my body.
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:31,786
- No!
- Give it!
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,293
Come on!
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:36,262
You know you want it.
You know you want it too.
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,970
Let's just be bad.
It'll feel so good.
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,638
Come on.
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,703
Oh, God, help me.
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,645
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay, good. Now do me.
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,678
Do my back.
Oh, come on. Harder!
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:51,780
There you go.
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:52,916
- Don't move.
- Why?
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,143
- Don't move.
- What are you...?
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,691
Stop that.
Stop that right now.
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:06,292
I might've expected this of Phoebe.
But, Ryan, you're a military man.
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:10,335
She make me doing.
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:15,907
- That's a nice color on you.
- You will become pink and blunch baby.
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,833
I hope you get a Winnie pork.
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:26,477
You and Milton have to join us
on the boat. Bring the kids.
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,218
We'll make a day of it.
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:31,115
That sounds lovely.
We'll have to set it up.
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,018
I better get back.
Hope the baby feels better.
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:35,918
Thanks.
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:38,287
- Bye-bye, Jeannie.
- Bye-bye, Joseph.
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:40,488
What a phony.
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:47,005
You'll teach her a lesson when she
steps off the dock onto nothing.
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,369
- Hey, Mr. Douglas.
- Sir.
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:55,012
Bing, I got your memo. We're not gonna
see the report until next Friday?
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,772
My group wants to spend
the holiday with family.
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:00,814
I have a family.
I'm gonna be here.
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,180
Yeah, Bing.
What's that about?
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,196
It's about cutting them
a little slack for morale.
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,294
Look, I can get some
rough numbers by Wednesday.
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,591
Rough numbers?
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,763
This company wasn't built
on rough numbers. Right, Mr. Douglas?
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,206
Have the final numbers
on my desk by Tuesday.
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,071
If you say so, sir.
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,372
Joseph's good, isn't he?
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,077
I'm going to kill you.
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:39,623
Hey, I just figured Joseph's
the kind of guy who likes to mix it up.
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:43,055
You know, get in there,
ruffle some feathers.
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,490
Why?
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,628
Look, I'm sorry,
but that's what Joseph does.
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,271
Okay? If you try to pull something...
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,365
...he'll call you on it.
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,375
"What are you trying to pull?"
He'll say.
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:04,577
Duct tape.
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,084
Was I supposed to bring something too?
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:12,421
This is for the scratchy twins.
I taped oven mitts to their hands.
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:15,092
You're strict.
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,158
Well, it's for their own good.
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:21,923
You know, I like the way you have
efficiently folded this tab under.
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:26,499
See, in a tape emergency you could
shave valuable seconds off your time.
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,735
Exactly!
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:34,210
God, I love that I can be
totally neurotic around you now.
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,012
Tell me the truth.
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:39,442
Don't you like having everything
on your desk perpendicular?
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:42,812
If it's not a right angle,
it is a wrong angle.
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:44,812
- Very good.
- Thank you.
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,751
Tomorrow, I'm gonna do your clocks.
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:50,591
You're gonna do what to my clocks?
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,260
Set them to my time.
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:55,923
I'm confused.
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,430
I thought we shared time.
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:03,637
No. See, in my bedroom
I set my clock six minutes fast.
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:04,773
Wanna know why?
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:09,480
Because it's in a slightly different
time zone than the kitchen?
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:10,714
Forget it.
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,176
No, come on, tell me.
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,247
- You don't understand.
- Come on.
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,488
You don't have any obsessive things.
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,518
No, that's not true.
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:20,849
Oh, yeah?
Tell me one of yours.
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:32,393
One of my things is
I always separate my sweat socks...
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:35,104
...from my dress socks.
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:39,544
What if they get mixed up?
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,712
Boy, I would just...
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,043
I would freak out.
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,685
You would not.
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:51,480
I can't believe this.
I hate this. You're too normal.
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:53,782
I can't believe you
don't have a "thing."
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,550
My boyfriend doesn't have a "thing."
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:59,990
See, if anyone overheard that,
I didn't come off well.
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:14,074
- Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
- Why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:18,305
He suspects you dropped the ball
on the Lender project.
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,742
Why? Why does he suspect that?
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,152
At first, he thought it was Joseph...
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:28,915
...but after he asked Joseph about it,
turns out it was you.
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:34,464
- Anyway, I thought you should know.
- All right. That's it.
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:35,961
Look, Joey...
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:39,101
...I realize this is the role
of a lifetime for you...
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:43,434
...and if I could just fire Joseph,
I would. But that's not possible.
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,370
So I have to let you both go.
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,481
What? Everybody loves Joseph.
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,682
I don't. I hate Joseph.
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,177
I think he's a brown-nosing suck-up.
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:00,953
You can't fire Joseph.
He's not in your department.
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:09,396
All right, okay.
So I can't fire Joseph...
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,662
...but I can sleep with his wife.
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,003
Not Karen!
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,606
Yeah, I'm thinking about
having an affair with her.
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:21,004
You know what?
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:22,676
I just did.
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,013
What the hell are you doing?
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,481
Oh, it's not me.
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:31,050
It's my character!
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:32,819
Chandie.
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:37,624
The rogue processor who seduces
his coworkers' wives...
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:39,830
...and then laughs about it.
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:43,568
In fact, I have her panties
right there in my drawer!
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,270
- Really?
- No, freak show, she's fictional!
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:48,930
Take it easy.
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:53,877
If it means that much to you,
I'll go find something else.
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:56,141
Thank you.
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:01,451
It's just that
I'm gonna miss Joseph.
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,348
I liked him. His wife.
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:05,917
She was hot.
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,929
And the kids, you gonna
put a pour like summer.
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,962
Please take these off.
I swear I won't scratch.
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,431
No, sorry, hon.
Monica's orders.
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,433
Well, that wasn't easy.
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:28,470
Okay, dinner's on.
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,676
There's a peach cobbler
warming in the oven.
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:36,013
So the plate's gonna be hot, but that
shouldn't be a problem for you.
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,587
All right, you kids.
Bye, now.
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,689
- Bye.
- Oh, look, look.
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:43,724
A low-budget puppet show.
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:48,991
A shame you can't see
what finger I'm holding up.
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,303
- Wine?
- Please.
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,749
- Spilled some.
- I got it.
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:21,465
You look beautiful tonight.
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:22,964
What?
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:25,934
Sorry.
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,197
You look beautiful.
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,657
You know what? That's it.
That's it.
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:58,565
Oh, yes.
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:01,869
Good.
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,976
You guys, did you?
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:19,653
Monica...
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:20,983
...wake up.
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,521
What's up?
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:25,059
I thought of a thing.
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,399
Yeah?
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:36,234
I have to sleep, have to,
on this side of the bed.
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:41,246
No. You have to sleep
on this side of the bed...
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:44,414
...because I have to sleep
on this side of the bed.
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,979
Or so I would have you believe.
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:56,024
So you have a side of the bed.
Everybody has a side of the bed.
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:59,162
Hey, come on. You haven't
heard my reason yet.
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:01,293
All right, go on.
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:04,964
I have to sleep on the west side...
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:08,297
...because I grew up in California...
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,132
...and otherwise...
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,770
...the ocean would
be on the wrong side.
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,047
Oh, my God.
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:22,116
You're a freak!
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,587
How about that?
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:30,617
Where're you shipping off to?
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,122
I really can't say.
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,592
Do you have nuclear weapons onboard?
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:36,459
I can't say.
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:39,566
Do you get to look through
a periscope thingy?
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:41,636
I'm sorry, but I can't say.
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:44,740
Wow, it's neat learning
about submarines.
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:48,342
- I better not miss my flight.
- I'll walk you out.
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:50,980
- Bye, Ryan.
- Pleasure. Take care.
00:20:56,655 --> 00:21:01,058
So do you think we could get you
one of those uniform things?
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,985
You like that, do you?
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:05,490
Oh, yeah.
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,095
I'll make some calls.
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:12,102
Can you believe that's how
we spent our two weeks?
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:14,134
We didn't do the romantic
things I'd planned...
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:18,969
...like having a picnic in Central Park
and coffee at Central Perk.
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,678
Oh, I just got that!
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:31,319
Taxi!
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,451
Bye, you.
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,409
I'm sorry, we're
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:58,074
Hey, sailor.
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,909
Is this what you had in mind?
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,316
I'll say.
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,395
I'm shipping out tomorrow.
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:12,259
Well, then...
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:16,501
...we better make this night count.
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:21,702
Wait, I forgot to turn off
the cappuccino machine.
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:32,143
Anchors aweigh.
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:36,980
Oh, wait, wait!
My purse, my purse!
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,421
I forgot to turn off
the bathroom light.
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,689
Why don't I just meet you upstairs?
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:53,669
Honey!
