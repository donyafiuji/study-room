00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:07,731
- It's not fair. It's my money.
- I know, but it's what Bread wanted.
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:10,802
- Ok, which one is she?
- That's Bread's widow.
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:14,046
- Why she didn't upset? - Because
she just find out and cut the wire.
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:22,988
- Didn't she find out she can't
define the money. - No.
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,961
- Oh, Drake.
- I'm sorry, Amber.
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:31,754
It's like Brad to have
to have the last word.
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,357
Sorry I'm late.
What happened?
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:35,725
We wanna see the end.
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:37,397
I want you, Drake.
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,830
I know you do.
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:41,199
But we can never
be together that way.
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:42,738
What?
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:45,000
There's something I never told you.
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:48,042
I'm actually your half-brother.
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:54,885
So what happens next?
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:58,586
I get the medical award
for separating the Siamese twins.
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:03,125
Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to
meet our other half-brother, Ramon...
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:08,164
...where I find the world's
biggest emerald. It's really big.
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,198
But it's cursed.
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:11,733
So cool!
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:13,767
God, that is good TV!
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:20,878
The One Where Dr. Ramoray Dies
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:05,218
Pheebs, play with me!
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:07,924
This game is grotesque!
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:12,062
Twenty armless guys joined
at the waist by a steel bar...
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:15,424
...forced to play soccer forever?
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,028
Hello? Human rights violation!
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:21,065
Don't feel so bad.
After playing...
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:25,243
...I break out the plastic women
and everybody has a good time.
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,974
Why don't you play with your roommate?
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,551
He's not a big fan of foosball.
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:35,515
Are we not getting along
with the new boy?
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:39,623
No, he's all right. He spends
most of his time in his room.
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,360
That's because you haven't
gotten to know him.
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,187
Let's remedy that, shall we?
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,598
- We don't need to.
- It'll be fun!
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:50,899
What was that?
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:56,639
I thought it'd be fun if we had
beers and got to know each other.
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,007
All right.
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:59,905
Oh, good! Okay.
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:04,583
Oh, no! I have to go,
because I'm late for...
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,910
...my Green Eggs and Ham
discussion group.
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,756
Tonight, it's "Why he would not
eat them on a train."
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,585
- Have fun! Bye!
- That was so lame.
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,124
I know.
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,395
Okay, talk to him.
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:27,205
So you think that Speed Racer guy
gets a lot of tickets or...?
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,776
That's good.
So who broke up with who?
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,104
I broke up with her.
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,838
She actually thought Sean Penn
was the capital of Cambodia.
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:42,584
When everybody knows that
the capital of Cambodia is...
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,453
It's not Sean Penn.
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:48,792
I got a funny one.
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:53,523
My last girlfriend, Tilly.
We're eating breakfast, right?
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:56,166
I made these pancakes.
Like, 50 pancakes.
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,428
All of a sudden,
she turns to me and says, "Eddie...
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,571
...I don't wanna see you anymore."
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:04,707
It was literally like she had
reached into my chest...
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:08,277
...ripped out my heart
and smeared it all over my life!
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:12,347
There was this incredible abyss
and I'm falling.
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:16,316
I keep falling and
I don't think I'm ever gonna stop!
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:22,661
That wasn't such a funny story.
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,765
And a crusty old man
Said I'll do what I can
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:32,367
And the rest of the rats
Played maracas
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:37,235
That's it! Thanks! Good night.
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:41,105
Phoebe's got another job, right?
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,177
Great set tonight, Pheebs.
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:45,543
I know.
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:47,883
We should get going.
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:51,419
We should too.
I've got patients at 8 in the morning.
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,888
You know how we always stay
at your apartment?
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,355
I thought tonight
we'd stay at my place.
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:59,056
I don't know.
I don't have my jammies.
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,962
You don't need them.
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:05,060
My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:07,931
Shut up. I'm happy.
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,807
Oh, this is so nice!
I have to make a speech.
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:18,109
Of all the guys that Monica has
been with, and that is a lot...
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,647
...I like you the best.
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:25,984
Thank you, Pheebs.
That's very sweet.
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:27,650
You hear that?
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:31,430
She likes me best. And apparently,
there have been a lot.
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,358
Not a lot.
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,101
Phoebe's kidding. Phoebe's crazy.
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,634
Phoebe's dead.
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,347
I'm looking for Eddie Manoick.
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,177
He's not here right now.
I'm Chandler.
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:55,283
Can I take a message or...
Or a fish tank?
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,647
Thanks.
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:58,520
Come on in.
00:05:58,958 --> 00:05:59,982
I'm Tilly.
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:09,128
I gather by that "Oh,"
he told you about me.
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,167
Yeah, your name came up...
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:15,896
...in a conversation that
terrified me to my very soul.
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,674
He's kind of intense.
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,675
Yes! Hey, can I ask you,
is Eddie a little...
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:22,812
A little what?
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,516
...bit country?
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:30,522
You know, a little rock and roll.
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,290
Come on in, you roomie!
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:36,825
Hello, Tilly.
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,463
Eddie, I just came by
to drop off your tank.
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:41,899
That was very thoughtful of you.
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,635
It's very thoughtful.
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:49,497
Well, okay then.
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,177
I'm gonna go. Bye.
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:57,706
So we getting a fish?
00:06:58,551 --> 00:06:59,677
You had sex with her.
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:05,615
Check it out, check it out!
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:09,988
Soap Opera Digest!
That's one of my favorite digests!
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,965
Page 42! Page 42!
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:19,765
"New Doc on the Block,
Days of our Lives Joey Tribbiani."
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,700
Cool picture!
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:23,935
Oh, I look good.
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:28,944
Is this true? That you write
a lot of your own lines?
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,048
Well, kind of, yeah.
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:35,252
Remember last week
when Alex was in the accident?
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:37,284
The line in the script was...
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:40,924
..."If we don't get this woman
to a hospital, she's going to die."
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,195
But I made it, "If this woman
doesn't get to a hospital...
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,330
...she's not gonna live."
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,436
Oh, okay.
I see what you did there.
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:57,965
Aren't you afraid the writers will be
kind of mad when they read this?
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:04,011
I never thought about the writers.
The scripts just come to my house.
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,284
But you know what?
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:11,921
This makes me look good,
which makes the show look good...
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:15,854
...which makes the writers look good.
So how could they be mad?
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,387
Makes up most of his lines.
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:20,894
Son of a...
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,633
Write this, jerk-weed.
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,567
I fall down an elevator shaft?
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,775
What does this mean?
I fall down an elevator shaft?
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,446
I don't know.
I just bring the scripts.
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:39,382
They can't kill me!
I'm Francesca's long-lost son!
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:41,276
Right.
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:43,587
Could you sign?
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,757
No! No way! I'm not signing that!
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:50,224
I don't think that will affect
the plot of the show.
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:53,658
How can they do this to me?
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,034
All right, I'm just gonna go.
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:00,828
Sorry.
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:09,171
Well, it wasn't that many guys.
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:12,282
If you consider how many guys
there actually are...
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,482
...it's a very small percentage.
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,984
It's not that big a deal.
I was just curious.
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,918
- Good night.
- Good night, Richard.
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:21,989
Good luck, Mon.
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:26,460
Before I tell you, you tell me
how many women you've been with.
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:29,532
Two.
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:32,129
Two? Two?
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:35,365
How is that possible? I mean...
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,667
...have you seen you?
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:41,176
I mean, what can I say?
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:45,543
I was married to Barbara for 30 years,
my high-school sweetheart.
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,718
Now you. That's two.
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,888
Two it is.
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,153
Time for bed.
I'm gonna brush my teeth.
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,887
No, wait a minute now!
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:57,857
Come on, it's your turn.
00:09:58,164 --> 00:09:59,893
Oh, come on!
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:04,896
You know, I don't need the
actual number. Just a ballpark.
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,431
Okay, it is definitely
less than a ballpark.
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,612
I am so glad
I'm not Monica right now.
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,541
Tell me about it.
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:21,376
So what's your magic number?
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:28,489
Come on, you know everyone
I've been with. All both of them.
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,427
Well, there's you.
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,660
Better not be doing these in order.
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,263
Billy Dreskin, Pete Carny.
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:40,931
Barry.
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:43,070
Paolo.
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:46,434
Oh, yes, the weenie from Turinie.
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,841
Honey, are you jealous of Paolo?
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:55,679
I'm so much happier with you
than I ever was with him.
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,912
- Really?
- Oh, please!
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:01,193
That Paolo thing was
barely a relationship.
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:05,086
All it really was
was just meaningless, animal sex.
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:13,967
Okay, you know, that sounded
so much better in my head.
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:17,402
I didn't sleep with
your ex-girlfriend.
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:20,840
That's exactly what someone
who slept with her would say.
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,206
This is nuts! Crazy!
She came over for two minutes...
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,610
...dropped off a fish tank and left!
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:27,816
Where's Buddy?
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:29,217
Buddy?
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,086
My fish, Buddy.
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,421
There was no fish
when she dropped it off.
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,321
This is unbelievable!
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:41,088
You sleep with my ex-girlfriend,
insult my intelligence by lying...
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,267
...then you kill my fish?
My Buddy?
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,295
I didn't kill your fish!
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,333
Look, Eddie
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,971
Would you look at what I'm doing?
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,979
Now that can't be smart.
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,520
So we're just gonna
take this guy right off you...
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:04,255
...and put him here in Mr. Pocket.
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:07,620
Tangelo?
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:21,196
That's it? That's the giant number
you were afraid to tell me?
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,532
Well, that's not bad at all.
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:26,471
You had me thinking it was,
like, a fleet.
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:28,936
You're okay with it?
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,876
Oh, honey, I'm fine.
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,418
Okay, about that two.
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:38,914
What?
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:40,125
All right.
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,185
What about my two?
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,056
It just seems like
a really small number.
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:46,286
Right.
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:51,769
Don't you have a lot
of wild oats to sow?
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:56,771
Or is that what you're doing with me?
Oh, my God! Am I an oat?
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,439
Honey, you are not an oat.
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:03,444
I don't know, I guess
I'm just not an oat guy.
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:05,582
I've only slept with women I love.
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:07,947
You've only slept with two people.
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:13,959
Right.
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:24,059
You know I love you too, right?
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,631
Now I do.
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:35,071
Ross, please listen to me.
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:38,282
You are so much better for me
than Paolo ever was.
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:41,543
You care about me, you're loving,
you make me laugh.
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:44,287
If I make you laugh, here's an idea.
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,616
Invite Paolo to have
a romp in the sack...
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,884
...and I'll stand in the corner
and tell knock-knock jokes!
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:56,492
What we have is special!
All Paolo and I ever had was
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:57,895
"Animal sex"?
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:02,900
So what are you saying?
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:06,076
There's nothing between us
"animal" at all?
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:10,212
There's not even,
like, a little animal?
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:12,006
Not even, like...
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:13,646
...chipmunk sex?
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:20,153
Try to hear me, okay?
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,485
I'm not gonna lie to you.
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:26,393
- It was good with Paolo.
- Knock-knock.
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:31,635
But what you and I have
is so much better.
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:36,237
We have tenderness,
we have intimacy, we connect.
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:37,908
You know? I swear.
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,236
This is the best...
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:43,140
...I have ever had.
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:45,613
Until now.
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,860
Richard told me he loved me.
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,185
- Oh, my God!
- I know!
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:58,760
Honey, that's great!
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,192
I know!
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:02,127
- I just can't find
- Top drawer.
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,996
- Hurry.
- Why? You need one too?
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:08,905
Found them!
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:14,476
There's only one.
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:21,650
We'll be right there.
We're just trying to decide something.
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:43,171
- They're trying to decide something.
- Good. Good, good.
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:53,678
So was your mustache
Did it used to be different?
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:03,795
How do you, you know,
keep it so neat?
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:06,628
I have a comb.
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,334
- What is that?
- A mustache comb.
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:14,869
Thank you.
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:20,075
Okay, I will do your laundry
for one month.
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:24,308
I will, I will, I will...
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,144
I will clean the apartment
for two months.
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:31,651
I'll give this to you now, if you
tell me where we keep the dustpan.
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:43,057
So were you in Nam?
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:53,044
We are both adults here.
We must got some way to solve this.
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,907
- Rock, paper, scissors?
- Gotcha.
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:58,209
One, two, three.
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,984
Yes!
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,513
Fine. Go have sex.
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,357
No! You have got it completely wrong!
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:11,427
John Savage was Deer Hunter,
no legs.
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,530
Jon Voight was Coming Home,
couldn't feel his legs.
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,930
You've got it totally the other way
around, my friend. Jon Voight
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,968
- Honey?
- What?
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:30,411
Shall we?
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,014
It's not gonna happen.
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:35,548
They're doing it tonight.
We can do it tomorrow.
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,788
In the future, if I could see
the schedule beforehand...
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:47,360
So when I woke up this morning...
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:50,727
...he'd stolen all the insoles
out of my shoes!
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,068
Why?
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:56,137
He thinks I slept with his
ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,171
Why would you kill his fish?
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:04,241
Because sometimes
after you sleep with someone...
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,815
...you have to kill a fish.
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,318
Chandler, honey...
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:11,714
...I'm sorry.
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:14,255
Can we watch Joey's show now, please?
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,294
Wait. He's not here yet.
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:18,052
He knows what happens.
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:22,500
I'm fine about my problem now,
by the way.
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:26,931
Amber...
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,971
...I'll always be there for you...
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,336
...as a friend and as your brother.
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:34,478
Oh, Drake.
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:36,476
Hard day, huh?
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,148
First the medical award, now this?
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,915
Some guys are just lucky, I guess.
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:46,316
Dr. Ramoray, report to
first floor Emergency stat.
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,649
Well, then...
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,591
...I guess that's me.
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:58,969
Anyone else need to go on the elevator?
Dr. Horton? Dr. Wall?
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:01,703
They only said you.
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:06,500
Oh, okay. All right.
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:07,675
I love you.
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,304
Yeah, whatever.
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:11,716
Oh, no!
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,281
Drake, look out!
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:20,187
- Did they just kill off Joey?
- No!
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:24,355
Now maybe.
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:29,025
Come on! Open up!
We want to talk to you!
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:30,667
I don't feel like talking!
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,665
Come on! We care about you.
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:37,099
- We're worried about you.
- And some of us really have to pee!
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:42,780
I'm sorry, Joey.
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,351
Listen, sorry about your death.
That really sucks.
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:52,352
- We came over as soon as we saw.
- How could you not tell us?
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:56,357
I don't know. I was kind of hoping
no one would ever find out.
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:00,856
Well, maybe they could find
a way to bring you back.
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:06,234
They said that when they found my body,
my brain was so smashed in...
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:10,066
...that the only doctor
who could've saved me was me.
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,105
It's supposed to be
some kind of irony.
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:17,775
But Joey, you're gonna be fine.
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:21,384
You don't need that show.
It was just a dumb soap opera.
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,748
This was the greatest thing
that ever happened to me.
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,618
Yes! I was going to incorporate that.
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:32,187
Here's Monica.
She'll have something nice to say.
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:37,290
I straightened out your shower curtain
so you won't get mildew.
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,331
What? To me, that's nice.
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,740
It'll be okay. You know that.
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:45,968
No, I don't.
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:50,611
It's like you work
your whole life for something...
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,908
...and you think
that when you get it...
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,483
...it'll never be
as good as you thought.
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:57,448
But this so was.
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,413
It changed everything.
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:02,819
Like, the other day,
I got this credit card application...
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:05,391
...and I was pre-approved!
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:11,333
I've never been pre-approved
for anything in my life!
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,094
I'm sorry, man.
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:16,603
I don't know if this'll mean
anything to you...
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:19,436
...but you'll always be
pre-approved with us.
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,373
That means nothing to me.
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,752
Pecan sandy? Just made them.
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,789
Yeah, all right.
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:37,426
Are these raisins?
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:39,726
Sure, why not?
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:48,502
Listen, Eddie.
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:52,609
I've been thinking about
our living situation.
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:54,710
Why are you smiling?
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,274
I got a little surprise.
Look. There's a new fishy.
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,348
I named him...
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:03,110
...Chandler, you know, after you.
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,027
Well, that's not even a real fish.
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:18,835
No, that's a Goldfish cracker.
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:22,366
So what's your point, man?
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:28,409
Okay, good night.
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:31,713
You big freak of nature!
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,371
- Brisk tonight.
- Oh, man.
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:03,914
- Let's never speak of this.
- You got it.
