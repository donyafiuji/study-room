00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:08,765
Hold on a second.
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:13,875
Nice.
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:16,644
I got you something.
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:17,747
What's this?
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:19,679
Eight hundred and twelve bucks.
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,780
Didn't Big Leon tell you?
It's a thousand...
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,923
...to have me for the whole night.
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:26,621
What's this for?
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,987
Well, I'm making money now.
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:34,132
I'm paying you back for headshots,
electric bills, all that pizza...
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,197
I love you, man.
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:38,632
Well, thanks, man.
Now I can get my pony.
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:42,499
This is a little extra something for...
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:44,471
...always being there for me.
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,141
Wow, I don't know what to say.
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,384
Wow, I don't know what to say.
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:57,822
What do you say?
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,320
I don't know.
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,285
It's a bracelet.
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:05,555
Isn't it? It's engraved, too.
Check it out.
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,761
"To my best bud."
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,097
Thanks, best bud.
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:16,240
Put it on.
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:17,510
Now?
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,976
No, it should be saved
for a special occasion.
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:26,084
No, that's the beauty part.
It goes with everything.
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:29,321
When you put this on,
you're good to go.
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:36,284
I'm never being good to go,
so why don't try some jewrel.
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:40,365
Oh, man!
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:43,462
You are so wearing that bracelet!
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:46,031
I so am!
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,773
Any idea what this will
do for your sex life?
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,738
It might slow down at first, but...
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:55,141
...once I'm used to the extra weight,
I'll be back on track.
00:01:56,983 --> 00:02:01,818
The One With the Prom Video
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:44,996
- This all looks good.
- Great.
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,459
If I want to call for a reference
on your last job...?
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:51,829
That's right there, see?
The manager, Chandler Bing?
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,398
All right.
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,599
Let's see if you're as good in person
as you are on paper. Make me a salad.
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,139
A salad? I could do
something more complicated.
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:04,111
No, just the salad will be fine.
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:05,882
You got it.
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:10,886
Now I want you to tell me what
you're doing while you're doing it.
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:15,424
All right. Well,
I'm tearing the lettuce.
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:16,658
Is it dirty?
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,329
Oh, I'm gonna wash it.
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,828
Don't. I like it dirty.
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,003
That's your call.
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,340
So, what are you going to do next?
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,108
I thought that I'd
cut up the tomatoes.
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,641
Are they firm?
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:36,778
They're all right.
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:38,916
You sure they haven't gone bad?
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:41,779
You sure they're not very, very bad?
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,091
No, really, they're okay.
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,587
You gonna slice them up real nice?
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,693
I was going to do them julienne.
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:55,895
I'm out of here!
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,477
Hello?
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:08,980
Rachel's not here.
Can I take a message?
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:11,715
How do we spell Casey?
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:15,011
Is it like "at the bat"
or "and The Sunshine Band"?
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:20,648
Hey, who's this Casey?
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,484
Some guy she met at the movies.
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:24,524
What does he want with her?
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,822
I guess he wants to
do a little dance...
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,197
...you know, make a little love...
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:35,606
Well, pretty much get down tonight.
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,343
I don't know. I don't
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:47,144
I don't get it! Two months ago,
Rachel and I were this close.
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:50,788
Now I'm taking messages from guys
she meets at the movies?
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:54,926
I mean, this Casey should be
taking down my messages, you know?
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:58,160
Or Rachel and I should be together...
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:01,390
...and we should get
some kind of message service.
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:04,035
Hang in there.
It's gonna happen.
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,703
Now, how do you know that?
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,703
Because she's your lobster.
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,477
Oh, she's going somewhere.
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:19,081
It's a known fact that lobsters
fall in love and mate for life.
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:23,413
You know what? You can actually
see old lobster couples...
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:27,386
...walking around their tank,
holding claws, like...
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:37,592
Hey, you feeling better?
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:41,203
Yeah, I think that fifth shower
got the interview off me.
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,942
Do you have other possibilities?
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,374
There is the possibility
that I won't make rent.
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,381
If you want,
I can lend you money.
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:54,418
If I couldn't pay you back right away,
I'd feel guilty and tense around you.
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,721
Then why not borrow it
from Mom and Dad?
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:00,755
You feel guilty and tense
around them already.
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,494
Might as well
make some money off of them.
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,858
The man's got a point.
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,300
What is that sparkly thing?
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,535
That thing?
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,366
Yeah, it's a little flashy.
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:18,441
No, no.
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:22,338
No, no. It's not flashy.
Not for a goodfella.
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:29,314
Man, that is sharp! That must
have cost you quite a few doubloons.
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,632
Hi, darling.
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:42,833
What's this?
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,468
Some of your old stuff.
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:48,104
Well, sweetie,
we have a surprise for you.
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,332
We're turning your room into a gym.
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,505
Wow, that is a surprise!
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,147
Just one question.
Why not Ross's room?
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,781
We talked about that...
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:03,682
...but your brother had so many
science trophies, plaques, merit badges...
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,787
We didn't want to disturb them.
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:07,424
God forbid!
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:11,828
What's with you. What can you tell us.
How is your job.
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,823
My job, well!
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,465
Do I mention that I still
don't have a boyfriend.
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,472
I just assume
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:31,212
We were so sorry to hear
about your parents splitting up.
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:35,217
Well, they're just separated.
You never know! We'll see.
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,582
I can't say any of us
were surprised.
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:42,923
They've been unhappy
ever since we've known them.
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:45,664
Especially after
that incident in Hawaii.
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:49,630
What? What incident?
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:53,065
No, no. I must be
thinking of someone else.
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:54,897
Maybe me!
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,302
Don't you have some folding to do?
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,067
Fold. You fold.
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,713
- Want a refill?
- I'm all right, thanks.
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:11,355
Give me a second.
I want to get this just right.
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:19,294
Dude, eleven o'clock,
totally hot babe checking you out.
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:25,993
That was really good.
I think I'm ready for my penis now.
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,809
I know what you're thinking.
Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:39,781
I'm Gail.
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:46,486
I really have to be somewhere,
but it was nice meeting you.
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:55,997
Excellent!
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:59,363
He could have gotten me a VCR
or a set of golf clubs.
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,039
But no! He got me
the "woman repeller"!
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:06,203
The eyesore from
the Liberace House of Crap!
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,504
- It's not bad.
- Easy for you to say.
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:11,806
You're not sporting a reject
from the Mr. Tcollection!
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:16,978
"I pity the fool that
puts on my jewelry! I do! I do!"
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,155
"I pity that fool"
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,157
Hey, man! We were just
doing some impressions.
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,830
Do your Marcel Marceau.
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:29,629
That's actually good.
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,205
Would you look at that guy?
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:42,346
How long has he
been talking to her?
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,108
I don't know. A couple of minutes.
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,911
Yeah, try doubling that.
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:51,083
It's like, back off, buddy!
She's a waitress, not a geisha.
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,423
I think she's okay.
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:55,889
Look at that!
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,358
She pushes him away
and he won't budge!
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,462
I'm gonna do something.
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:03,733
We'll get a condo...
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,803
...right on the mountain.
Ski in, ski out, it's great.
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,801
Excuse me? Are you Rachel?
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,310
What?
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:13,611
Ross Geller.
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:17,578
God, in your ad you said
you were pretty, but wow!
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:20,615
What are you doing?
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:23,651
Oh, my God, is this the wrong day?
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,288
I don't believe it!
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:29,322
If it works out, we'll have
something to tell the grandkids!
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:30,890
You sure will.
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:32,824
I've gotta go.
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,930
Take care.
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:36,299
See you later.
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,200
You're welcome.
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:45,340
- What?
- I was saving you.
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:49,275
Saving me from a pleasant
conversation with an interesting man?
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:50,504
From where I was
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,283
Okay, Ross, listen to me.
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:55,145
I am not yours to save.
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:57,020
But you are.
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:58,085
What?
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:00,820
You're my lobster.
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,528
Are you being
the blind-date guy again?
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:11,630
No, you're my lobster.
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:14,304
Lobsters...
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,841
In the tank, when they're old...
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:22,870
...they get with the
They walk around holding the claws.
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,207
In the tank!
You know, with...
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,115
...with the holding and...
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:32,221
Pheebs, you wanna help me
with the lobster thing?
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,322
Do the claws again.
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,454
Rach, forget the lobsters, okay?
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:40,493
Let's talk
What about us?
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:43,997
Ross, there is no "us," okay?
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:46,661
No! Listen to me!
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:49,101
I fell for you and I get clobbered.
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:52,542
You then fall for me
and I again get clobbered.
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:56,407
I'm tired of being
clobbered, you know?
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,183
It's just not worth it.
00:11:58,484 --> 00:11:59,644
Well, but
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,716
No "but," Ross.
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:05,855
We are never gonna happen, okay?
Accept that.
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:09,024
Except that what?
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,623
No. No.
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,563
Accept that.
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:40,514
Hey, man! Look, it's my best bud!
How you doing?
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:45,092
You're getting good at that
Marcel Marceau thing.
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:50,393
What do you say we play some ball?
You and me, huh?
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,863
Okay, that's my bad.
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,705
If you hated the bracelet,
you should have just said so.
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:01,946
Doesn't the fact that I wore it...
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:05,048
...say how much
our friendship means to me?
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:09,118
But you insulted the bracelet
and you made fun of me.
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,383
Well, that's the part
where I'm a wank.
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:15,454
I was hoping you
wouldn't focus on that.
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:18,861
I am focus on this.
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,503
How we argue that
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:29,006
Come on, man! I said I was
sorry a hundred times.
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,674
I promise, I will never
take it off my...
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:33,678
...wrist.
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,709
But if you want to
stay in there and be mad...
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,920
...you just, you stay in there.
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:43,778
You know what the
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,057
I am here, on my knees...
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,628
...holding up these couch cushions...
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:53,559
...as a symbol
of my sorrow and regret.
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,994
Much like they did
in biblical times.
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,102
Though you may haveth anger now...
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:05,508
You are gonna grab
something, aren't you.
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,976
You know, that Steffi Graf
has quite a tush.
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,455
I'm just saying!
It's right there!
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,153
Hey, guys.
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,824
Hi, darling.
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:23,691
Where is my grandson,
You didn't bring him?
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:26,830
He's at Carol and Susan's today.
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,330
A woman in my office is a lesbian.
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,500
I'm just saying!
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:37,975
Jack, look! There's that house
paint commercial that cracks you up!
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,108
- Where have you been?
- Emotional hell.
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,874
Did they lend you the money?
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:48,949
No, I haven't asked them yet.
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,815
Come on, Monica, do it.
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,455
Hey, you guys.
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:54,785
Monica has some news.
00:14:56,161 --> 00:15:00,291
So listen, I'm sorry I didn't
tell you this before, but...
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:05,064
...I'm no longer at my job.
I had to leave it.
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:06,168
Why?
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:08,536
Because they made me.
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:13,676
You were fired?
What are you gonna do?
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:18,145
Judy, relax. This is our little
Harmonica we're talking about.
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,577
We taught her well.
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:23,982
- Ten percent of your paycheck,
where does it go? - In the bank.
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:27,917
So she dips into her savings.
That's what it's there for.
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,526
She's gonna be fine.
Aren't you sweetie.
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:34,795
If you need a little extra...
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:37,194
...you know where to find it.
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:39,460
Anything larger back there?
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,830
I can't believe it!
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,632
Would you stop already?
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:47,846
Get out of the bitter barn
and play in the hay.
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,548
Oh, you're right.
I should play in the hay.
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:55,014
I just dropped $400 to replace
a bracelet I hated to begin with.
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,982
Bring on the hay!
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:58,619
Hey!
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:03,358
I've got something
that'll make you happy.
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,324
Guess what Gunther found?
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,466
Hey, now you have two!
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:12,966
Oh, now you have two.
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,668
What am I gonna do?
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,140
How come you have two?
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:27,977
This one's for you.
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:30,050
Get out!
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:31,789
No, I can't.
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,454
I know how much this means to you...
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:38,890
...and this is about more than jewelry.
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,691
It's about you and me
and the fact that we're "best buds."
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,736
Is this friendship?
I think so!
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,868
Check it out!
We're bracelet buddies!
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,537
That's what they'll call us!
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:59,707
Okay, here you go.
Pay me back whenever you like.
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,046
You have dinosaur checks?
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:06,618
You get your money
and you learn something.
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,087
What's wrong with that?
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,554
Nothing.
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,422
Hey, you're a cheap-a-saurus!
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,967
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
Thank you, I'm very grateful.
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,636
Hey, Mon, what is this?
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:26,100
That's my bathing suit from high
school. I was a little bigger then.
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:30,814
I thought they used that
to cover Connecticut when it rains.
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:34,182
Hey, what's on this videotape?
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,047
I don't know.
Let's put it in.
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:48,395
Over here, Jack. Okay.
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,727
Rachel's coming up the path.
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:53,096
Doesn't she look pretty? Jack?
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:54,464
Can you get this?
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:58,999
Oh, my God!
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:01,178
What is with your nose?
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:07,613
They had to reduce it
because of my deviated septum.
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:11,888
Okay, I was wrong. That's
what they use to cover Connecticut.
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,918
This is us getting ready
for the prom.
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:17,794
We don't have to watch.
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:18,826
Yeah, we do.
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,463
- Come on!
- It's fun!
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,131
Get a shot of Monica.
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:23,197
Where's Monica?
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:24,833
Over here, Dad!
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,965
Wait. How do you zoom out?
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,700
There she is!
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:36,943
Some girl ate Monica!
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:42,119
Shut up!
The camera adds ten pounds.
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,922
So how many cameras
are actually on you?
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:50,093
Oh, you look so great!
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:53,092
So do you! You look beautiful!
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:54,866
- Oops.
- What?
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,065
I think I got mayonnaise on you.
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,804
Oh, it's just the shoulder,
not my dress.
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:03,902
Everybody smile!
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,177
Oh, Dad, turn it off!
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:07,241
It is off.
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,709
It is not!
What's with the red light?
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:11,472
It's the off light.
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,183
Right, Ross?
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,353
Looking good, Mr. IKotter.
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:30,330
- You look pretty tonight.
- Oh, thanks.
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:36,603
- What are you doing this summer?
- I'm gonna hang out...
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,877
...work on my music.
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:45,711
Is my hook unhooked?
These things keep falling down.
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,582
Let me see. I don't know.
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,426
What are you gonna do...
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:58,491
The guys are here!
00:19:58,764 --> 00:19:59,856
...this summer?
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:01,190
Work on your music?
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,039
Oh, my God!
There's Roy Gublik!
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:13,472
You know, Roy saw
Star Wars 317 times.
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:14,938
He was in the paper.
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,713
Where's Chip?
Why isn't he here yet?
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,682
He'll be here, okay?
Take a chill pill.
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:25,113
There.
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:33,690
I just told Rachel
that Roy touched my boob.
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:41,167
I can't go to the prom without a date.
I can't! It's too late!
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,338
If you're not going,
then I don't want to go.
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:47,111
Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass!
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:50,906
I have a wonderful idea.
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:53,879
You should take Rachel to the prom.
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:55,917
Doubtful.
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:59,055
Jack, give me that.
Talk to your son.
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,820
All right, go on.
This thing's heavy.
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,622
Your mother's right.
Take her. You can wear my tux.
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,332
She won't wanna go with me.
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:11,501
Of course she would!
You're a college man!
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:13,968
- I don't know.
- Well, come on.
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:16,002
Don't you wanna find out?
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,706
I can't believe
I can't go to the prom!
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:21,468
This is so harsh!
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,087
- Hold my board.
- Thataboy! Thataboy!
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:31,146
I think we've seen enough.
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,448
Let's turn it off.
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:35,352
Well, I'm not gonna watch.
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,088
Come on, kid. Let's go!
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:43,994
- My! Are you handsome!
- Let's show them!
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:45,896
Just a sec, Dad.
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:49,373
Okay, be cool. Just be cool.
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:00,013
Okay, Dad.
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:04,153
Rachel, ready or not,
here comes your knight in shining
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:05,617
Oh, no.
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:07,786
Don't wait up!
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:09,352
Chip!
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:12,697
Oh, dear!
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:15,157
How do I turn this off?
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:16,726
Press the button.
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:18,868
Which one? Which button? Jack!
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:20,696
The button! The button!
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,904
I can't believe you did that.
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:31,471
Yeah, well...
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:02,476
See? He's her lobster!
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:12,551
Dance with him!
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,558
Mom, I'm hungry!
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,755
Dance with your father.
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:21,295
I don't know any of your flashdances,
but I'm no slouch on the dance floor.
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,794
All right.
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:31,608
- Oh, Jack!
- Oh, Judy!
