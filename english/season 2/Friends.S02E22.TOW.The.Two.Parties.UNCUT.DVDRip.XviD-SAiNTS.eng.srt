00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:09,298
I'll get candles and
my mom's lace tablecloth.
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:11,668
And since it's Rachel's birthday...
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:14,106
...I thought I'd poach a salmon.
00:00:14,981 --> 00:00:15,811
What?
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:20,110
Question. Why do we always
have parties where you poach things?
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:21,820
You want to be on the food committee?
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:25,147
Question 2. Why do we always
have parties with committees?
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:29,458
Why can't we just get pizza
and beer and have fun?
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:33,723
I agree. Fancy parties are only fun
if you're fancy on the inside.
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,661
And I'm not sure we are.
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,365
You don't want it to be special?
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,266
Fine. You can throw
any kind of party you want.
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,340
Joey, they're not real!
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:49,541
I start miles beneath the surface
of these things. They're fake.
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:51,316
See?
Honk, honk!
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:55,980
Wow, it's like porno for clowns!
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:02,826
The One With Two Parties
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:47,602
Neither of Rachel's sisters can come.
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:51,275
I still have to invite Dylan
and Emma and Shannon Cooper.
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,673
No Shannon Cooper.
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:55,141
Why not her?
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:56,346
Because she...
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,244
She steals stuff.
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:05,690
Or maybe she doesn't and Joey slept
with her and never called her back.
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,252
Joey, that is horrible.
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:10,690
Hey, I liked her.
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,261
Maybe too much.
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:14,022
I don't know.
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,529
I guess I just got scared.
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,501
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,236
I didn't think anyone
would buy that. Okay!
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:26,176
Hi, honey.
How did it go?
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:28,312
It was the graduation from hell.
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:31,778
My cousin went to hell
on a football scholarship.
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:35,016
It's supposed to be a joyous occasion.
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,347
My sister would graduate from college.
Nobody thought she would.
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:42,817
It's a testament to what a girl
from Long Island will do for a Celica.
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:44,794
What happened?
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,157
My parents happened.
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:49,368
All they had to do was sit
in the same stadium, smile...
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:52,764
...and not talk about the divorce.
But no!
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,564
They got into a fight
during the commencement address.
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:59,834
Bishop Tutu actually
had to stop and shush them.
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,512
You know the good news?
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,378
I get to serve coffee
for the next eight hours.
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,785
I guess we don't invite her parents.
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,390
- How about just her mom?
- Why her mom?
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:15,758
Because I already invited her.
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,330
Did you ask Stacy Roth?
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:19,826
Can't invite her.
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,099
She also steals.
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,109
So does her roomate.
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,383
Here are the candles.
Where's the birthday cake?
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:42,518
We're not having birthday cake.
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,517
We're having birthday flan.
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:47,825
Excuse me?
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,961
It's a traditional
Mexican custard dessert.
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,561
That's nice.
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:54,527
Happy birthday, Rachel.
Here's some goo!
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:02,705
Dr. Greene!
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,006
Oh, my God!
It's Rachel's dad.
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:08,942
Why are you here?
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,877
The father can't see
the daughter on her birthday?
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,881
No, no, the father can.
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:17,884
But since I am the roommate,
I can tell you she's not here.
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:21,183
And I'll pass along the message.
Okay? So bye-bye.
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,323
You're having a party.
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,265
No, no, not a party.
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:29,626
Just a surprise gathering
of some people Rachel knows.
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:33,565
- This is Phoebe, Chandler and Joey.
- I'll never remember all that.
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,131
So what's the deal?
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:40,037
Rachel comes home, people pop out
and yell stuff? Is that it?
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:43,714
This isn't your first
surprise party, is it, sir?
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,120
Hi, Monica.
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:54,124
The Chinese menu guy.
Forgot the menus.
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:57,055
So basically, just a Chinese guy.
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:02,962
Dr. Greene, come with me.
We'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:08,606
All right.
That sounds like a two-person job.
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,442
Well, my goodness!
What was that?
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:18,275
Sandra, I thought you were Rachel.
We weren't ready for you yet.
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:22,249
- You thought I was Rachel?
- Yes, because you look so young.
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:25,047
And because you're both,
you know, white women.
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:31,957
Oh, I missed you kids.
Should I put my coat in the bedroom?
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,594
- No, I'll take that for you.
- Oh, well, thank you.
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,100
Such a gentleman.
Thank you.
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:46,975
It all looks so nice.
So festive. All the balloons.
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:51,482
Oh, the funniest thing happened
to me on the way here.
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:54,252
- I was driving
- That's great!
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,822
I can't wait to hear the rest,
but I have to go to the bathroom.
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,754
Hey, come with me.
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,491
- What?
- It will be like we're gal pals.
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:08,528
You know, like at a restaurant.
It'll be fun! Come on.
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,337
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,076
Think. Think.
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:20,505
What would Jack and Chrissy do?
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:25,815
Okay, now that your coat
is safely in the bed
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:28,383
We can come back out
in the living room.
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:32,954
Joey and Chandler, it's time
you take Dr. Greene over to your place.
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:35,023
Yes, absolutely.
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:37,292
Why, again?
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,199
Because that's where
the party is, you goon!
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:46,769
- See, this is just the staging area.
- Right, it's the staging area.
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:50,008
This is clearly
in the wrong apartment.
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:58,706
All right, you guys are off
to party number one.
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:01,813
And you...
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,488
You are off to party number two.
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:08,218
All right, let's keep it moving,
let's keep it moving.
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,997
At least send some women to my party.
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,268
Okay, that's Ross. All right.
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:19,770
Okay, they're coming.
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,277
Thank you for such a wonderful dinner.
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,679
Thanks for being born.
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,977
Thank you for my beautiful earrings.
They're perfect.
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:36,347
I love you.
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:40,283
Now, you can exchange them
if you want, okay?
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,085
Now I love you even more.
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:49,566
Surprise!
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:51,903
Oh, my gosh!
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:53,001
Wow!
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:55,900
Oh, my God. Mom!
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,404
This is so great!
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,812
Happy birthday, sweetie.
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:04,007
You! I had no idea!
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,410
- Really?
- No, I knew.
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:06,811
All right.
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,218
There's food and drinks on the table.
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:13,083
Go across the hall.
Right now, Joey and Chandler's.
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,587
- Why?
- Just go.
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:18,228
Weird.
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,430
Surprise!
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,262
Happy birthday, sweet pea.
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:26,596
Daddy!
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:37,515
Both of them are here? Both of them?
Both of them are here?
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,115
Well, we could count again?
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,184
I can't believe this!
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:43,911
You know, this is ridiculous.
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:46,453
This is your birthday, your party.
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,855
Let's put them together.
If they can't deal with it, who cares?
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,087
- I do.
- That's who.
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:55,397
Are you gonna be okay?
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:59,435
I don't really have a choice.
I can look at the bright side.
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,538
I get two birthday parties
and two birthday cakes.
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:04,002
Well, actually...
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,669
...just one birthday flan.
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,544
It's a traditional
Mexican custard dessert.
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,343
Talk to Monica.
She's on the food committee.
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:25,719
Some girl just walked up to me
and said, "I want you, Dennis"...
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,432
...and stuck her tongue
down my throat.
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,095
I love this party!
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,362
- Quick volleyball question.
- Volleyball.
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,607
We set up a court in your room.
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:38,275
You didn't like
that gray lamp, did you?
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:43,609
A woman stuck her tongue down my
throat. I'm not even listening to you.
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,745
- Dennis!
- Okay, that's me.
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,122
Can you keep Dad occupied?
I'm gonna talk to Mom for a while.
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,859
Do you have any ideas
for any openers?
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,753
Stay clear of "I'm the guy
that's doing your daughter"...
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,066
...and you should be okay.
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,270
I want you to take a piece of paper
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:09,440
Here you go. And write down
your most embarrassing memory.
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:14,446
When you're not using the markers,
put the caps back on them...
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:16,705
...because they will dry out.
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:19,048
Hi, Dr. Greene.
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,118
So how's everything in the...
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:25,790
...vascular surgery...
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:27,121
...game?
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:31,895
It's not a game, Ross.
A woman died on my table today.
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:33,759
I'm sorry.
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:38,029
That's the good thing about my job.
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,535
All the dinosaurs on my table
are already dead.
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,804
Listen, I don't mean
to be a pain about this...
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:50,140
...but I've noticed some of you
are just placing them on.
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,180
You want to push the caps...
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,144
...until you hear them click.
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,786
Gunther!
00:10:59,025 --> 00:10:59,957
Where you going?
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:02,820
I was sort of thinking about maybe
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:06,064
No! No, you can't go!
No, this is fun.
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,867
We're just starting.
Here's your marker.
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,867
If you want to go, just go.
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,039
She'll yell at me again.
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,243
All right, I can get you out.
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,504
What?
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,685
In a minute, I'll create a diversion.
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:31,616
When I do, walk quickly to the door
and don't look back.
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,627
- I think I need a drink.
- I'll get it for you.
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,829
- What do you want?
- Scotch.
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:42,431
I'll be back in 10 seconds with
your scotch on the rocks in a glass.
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:43,564
Neat!
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,202
Cool.
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:49,103
Neat, as in no rocks.
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:50,873
I know.
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:58,247
Hello, Ross!
Where have you been?
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:01,817
I have been in the bathroom.
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,322
Stay clear of the salmon mousse.
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,489
Scotch neat.
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:13,989
That's Rachel's father's drink.
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,502
Mine too. Isn't that neat?
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:21,032
Scotch neat.
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,768
Would you excuse me?
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,512
Where are you sneaking off to, mister?
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:37,146
I'm getting my cigarettes.
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:38,287
No.
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:39,855
What do you mean "no"?
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,789
See, because that's the staging area.
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:46,587
You go in there, it'll ruin
the whole illusion of the party.
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,791
Take your scotch back in there...
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:53,368
...and I will get
your cigarettes for you, sir.
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,799
- Get my glasses too.
- All righty-roo.
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,540
What a great moment to say that
for the first time.
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:11,186
Okay, the first person's
most embarrassing memory is...
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,448
..."Monica, your party sucks."
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,889
Very funny.
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:19,860
Oh, no! Did someone forget
to use a coaster?
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,259
What?
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,907
I don't see anything.
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,370
Great, I'm seeing water rings again.
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,747
Ross, whose glasses are those?
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:40,707
Mine.
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,022
You wear bifocals?
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,150
I have a condition apparently...
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,259
...that I require...
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:55,063
...two different sets of focals.
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:59,502
Do you know my husband
has glasses just like that?
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,400
Well, those are very popular frames.
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,733
Neil Sedaka wears them.
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,214
I hear you can get people out of here.
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,483
You didn't tell me
your boyfriend smokes.
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:19,121
Yeah, like a chimney.
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:22,052
Big smoker.
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,425
Big, big smoker.
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:29,666
In fact, I'm gonna go into the hallway
and fire up this bad boy.
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,982
Are you wearing my glasses?
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,484
Yes.
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:54,023
I was just warming up
the earpieces for you.
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:55,926
Thank you.
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,498
Is that one of my cigarettes?
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:10,974
Yes, it is. I was just
moistening the tip.
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:16,312
She's taking the trash out,
so I can get you out of here.
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:18,879
But it has to be now.
She'll be back any minute.
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:20,048
What about my friend?
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,777
Only the three of you.
Any more and she'll get suspicious.
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,581
- Let me just get my coat.
- There isn't time!
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,527
Just leave everything.
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,294
They'll take care of you next door.
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,730
Is it true they have beer?
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,334
Everything you've heard is true.
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,571
Could you guys please keep it down?
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:45,572
We're trying to start
a Boggle tournament.
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:50,547
True, if these people find out a funny game,
then will be no people left in our party.
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:57,184
You!
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:58,513
And you.
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,689
You're supposed to be at my party.
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,756
And Gunther!
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,025
What are you doing here?
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,632
Welcome to the fo
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:21,745
All right, I'm sorry.
But these people needed me.
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,211
They work hard all week.
It's Saturday night.
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,611
They deserve to have a little fun.
Go!
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,615
You know, my party is fun.
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:32,515
It's a little quieter,
less obvious sort of fun.
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,851
But if people would just
give it a chance, it's
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:44,727
- You want me to see a therapist?
- Sweetheart, you have a problem.
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,599
You've chosen a boyfriend
exactly like your father.
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,805
Okay, Mom, I'll make an appointment.
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:55,272
But right now, I gotta go.
I gotta go do a thing.
00:16:55,547 --> 00:17:00,348
Did you know your mother
spent $1200 on bonsai trees?
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,447
I felt like Gulliver.
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:06,319
Daddy, I really want
to hear more about this...
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:09,752
...but I just have to do some stuff.
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,964
You work and you work
and you work at a marriage...
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:15,598
...but all he cares about
is his stupid boat.
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:18,630
You work and you work
and you work on a boat.
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:21,804
He always ridiculed my pottery classes.
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:23,974
And you sand it and varnish it.
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:27,804
But when all is said and done,
he still drinks out of the mugs.
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,981
One night of her yoga
and Bridges of Madison County...
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:34,012
- The scotch, the cigarettes...
- The bonsais and the Chihuahua...
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,514
I may have only been in therapy
for three weeks now but
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:39,289
What the hell does she want
with half a boat?
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:46,653
Okay, okay, you can be shirts
and I'll be skins.
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:49,496
I'll be skins!
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:58,503
How you holding up there, big tiger?
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:04,045
Sorry. When my parents were getting
divorced, I got a lot of "tigers."
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:08,351
I got a lot of "champs,"
"chiefs," "sports."
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,846
I even got a "governor."
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,791
This is it, isn't it?
This is what my life will be like.
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,219
My mom there, my dad there.
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,065
Thanksgiving, Christmas.
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:25,861
She gets the house, he's in a condo
my sister will decorate with wicker.
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,899
How did you get through this?
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:34,044
I relied on a carefully
regimented program...
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:35,780
...of denial...
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,545
...and wetting the bed.
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,717
You know, I just
It's so weird.
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:48,652
I mean, I was in there just listening
to them bitch about each other.
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:51,657
All I kept thinking about
was the Fourth of July.
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,266
Because it reminded you of the way...
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:58,129
...our forefathers used
to bitch at each other?
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:01,698
It's just this thing.
Every year we would...
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,703
...go out on my dad's boat
and watch the fireworks.
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:09,269
Mom always hated it because
the ocean air made her hair all big.
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:12,608
My sister Jill would be
throwing up over the side...
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,612
...and Dad would be upset
because nobody helping.
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:19,014
And when we did help, he'd scream
at us for doing it wrong.
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:26,424
But then when the fireworks started,
everybody just shut up.
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:29,262
You know, and it'd get really cold.
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:33,129
And we'd all just sort of
smoosh under this one blanket.
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:36,498
It never occurred to anybody
to bring another one.
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,709
And now it's...
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:44,779
Yeah, I know.
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,141
Thanks for coming.
I hope you had fun.
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,543
All right, I'm hitting the road.
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:15,711
Now, I've left my 10 verbs
on the table.
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:18,143
Be sure and send me
that finished poem.
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:20,280
Okay, will do. Glad you came.
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:23,644
- I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.
- Let me go check.
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,325
Your mom wants to say goodbye.
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,560
Happy birthday, sweetie.
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:34,799
You drive safe.
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:37,999
What are you doing?
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:42,737
I'm getting ready
for the water skiing.
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,236
Okay, big hug. One more.
Come on!
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:49,371
How are you?
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,750
- Where are you going?
- To get my coat.
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,383
We'll get that for you.
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:58,656
All right, all right.
I can get my own coat.
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:09,025
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:14,499
Oh, no. No, you're not
supposed to be here.
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:18,071
This is the staging area.
It's all wrong. You should leave.
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,108
You know, just get out.
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,250
Or perhaps you'd like
a creme de menthe.
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:35,917
I have to be heading
toward my chateau.
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:38,991
I guess we're going back
into the hallway again.
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,266
Thanks for coming, Mrs. Greene.
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:55,545
You take care.
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:00,675
Oh, you kids.
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:04,418
Well.
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:09,251
This is the best party
I've been to in years.
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:11,387
Thank you!
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,429
Okay, everybody,
it's time for flan!
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:23,003
Yep! Get ready
for the gelatinous fun.
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:27,375
Looks like that stuff you get
when you get an infection.
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,374
Okay, that's enough.
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,343
Okay, Rachel,
make a special flan wish.
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,243
Okay, I've got one.
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:40,682
Heads up!
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:45,753
Wow! Those things almost
never come true.
