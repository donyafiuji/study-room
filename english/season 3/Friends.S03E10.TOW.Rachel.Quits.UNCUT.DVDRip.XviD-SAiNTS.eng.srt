00:00:02,535 --> 00:00:04,799
- I don't know.
- What?
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,530
Well, as old as he is
in dog years...
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:11,233
...do you think Snoopy should
still be allowed to fly this thing?
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:13,605
- Rachel?
- Yeah?
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:17,647
You remember when you first came here,
how you spent two weeks getting trained?
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:20,581
Sure. Do you need me
to train somebody new?
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:23,081
Good one.
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:29,421
Actually, Terry wants you to take
the training again. Whenever.
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:34,828
Do you believe that?
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:41,462
Yeah.
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:49,880
The One Where Rachel Quits
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:33,854
So that's two boxes
of the Holiday Macaroons.
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:38,755
On behalf of the Brown Birds of America,
I salute you.
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,494
Just admit it, Chandler.
You have no backhand.
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:46,536
Excuse me, little one.
I have a very solid backhand.
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:50,036
Shielding your face
and shrieking like a girl...
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:52,038
...is not a backhand.
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,205
I was shrieking...
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:56,674
...like a Marine.
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:03,252
All right, here. Watch me execute
the three P's of championship play.
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,616
Power.
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:06,547
Precision.
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:08,153
And panache.
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,800
You broke a little girl's leg?
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,701
I know. I feel horrible, okay?
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:21,897
It says here that a Muppet got whacked
on Sesame Street last night.
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,104
Where exactly were you around 10-ish?
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:30,374
Well, I'm gonna go see her.
I wanna bring her something.
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,178
- What do you think she'd like?
- Maybe a Hello Kitty doll?
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,614
The ability to walk?
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,250
I'm gonna get back to re-training.
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,587
All right. See you guys.
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:45,627
Look out, kids! He's coming!
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,802
And I gotta go sell
some Christmas trees.
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:53,628
Have fun.
Wait! No, don't!
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:57,070
I forgot. I am totally
against that now.
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:00,773
What? Me having a job?
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,280
No. No, I am against innocent trees
being cut down in their prime...
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:08,383
...and their corpses
grotesquely dressed...
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:11,215
...in, like, tinsel and twinkly lights.
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,859
Hey, how do you sleep at night?
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,723
Well, I'm pretty tired
from lugging the trees around.
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,468
Hey, Phoebe, listen.
You got this all wrong.
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,762
Those trees were born
to be Christmas trees.
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:28,998
They're fulfilling their life purpose
by making people happy.
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:30,367
Really?
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,446
Yes.
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:36,840
Yes, and the trees are happy too...
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:39,276
...because, for most of them,
it's their only...
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,246
...chance to see New York.
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:47,422
After you've delivered the drinks,
take the tray...
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:51,186
Gunther, please. I have worked here
for two and a half years.
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:54,092
I know the empty trays go over there.
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,460
What if you put them here?
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,897
You know, that's actually a good idea.
They'll be closer to the mugs.
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:06,704
You know what? You should have
the other waitresses do that too.
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,143
They already do.
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,815
That's why they call it the tray spot.
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:14,077
Jeez, I always heard them
talk about that.
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:18,246
I sort of just thought it was, like,
a club they went to. Oh, God.
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,792
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,656
Sweetheart.
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:31,562
So this must be
kind of neat for you, huh?
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,431
Your dad tells me you get
a couple of days off school...
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:37,804
...and you don't have to sell
those cookies anymore.
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,643
Well, I kind of wanted
to sell the cookies.
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,339
The girl who sells the most
wins a trip to Space Camp...
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,814
...and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,423
Wow, you really like
all this space stuff, huh?
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:55,387
Yeah. My dad says if I spend as much
time helping him clean apartments...
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,995
...as I do daydreaming
about outer space...
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:00,995
...he'd be able to afford
a trip to the Taj Mahal.
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,398
I think you'd have to clean a whole lot
of apartments to go all the way to India.
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:08,733
No. The one in Atlantic City.
Dad loves the slots.
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:14,313
He says he's gonna double the
college money my grandma left me.
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,248
Well, good luck to Dad.
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:25,881
Say, how many more boxes would
you have to sell in order to win?
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:30,426
- The girl who won last year sold 475.
- Yeah?
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,497
So far, I've sold 75.
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,534
Four hundred, huh?
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:42,241
Well, that sounds doable.
How much are the boxes?
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:43,568
Five dollars a box.
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,508
And what is second prize?
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:51,340
A 10-speed bike. But I'd rather have
something my dad couldn't sell.
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:55,543
Well, that makes sense.
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,245
Could you do me one favor?
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:00,187
- Lf it's not too much trouble.
- Yeah, Sarah. Anything.
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,327
Could you pull the curtains open for me?
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,292
The astronauts from the space
shuttle are gonna be on the news.
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,966
Since we don't have a TV,
the lady across the alley...
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:11,625
...said she'd push hers up
to her window so I can watch it.
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:25,277
Yes?
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:28,045
Yeah, hi. I'm selling
Brown Bird cookies.
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:32,816
You're no Brown Bird.
I can see you through my peephole.
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:38,496
No. Hi. I'm an honorary Brown Bird.
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:42,628
What does that mean?
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:48,772
Well, it means that I can sell cookies,
but I'm not invited to sleepovers.
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:54,706
I can dial 911 at the press
of a button, you know.
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,142
Now, go away!
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,146
Please, please.
It's for a poor little girl...
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,820
...who wants to go to Space Camp
more than anything in the world.
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,453
I'm pressing.
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,783
A policeman is on his way.
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:09,518
Okay, okay.
I'm going, I'm going.
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,268
I can still see you!
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:17,493
All right!
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,735
- Hey.
- Hey.
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,035
What are you doing here?
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:27,769
Well, I thought
a lot about what you said...
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,472
...and I realize maybe
I was a little judgmental.
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,912
Yeah. But...
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,520
Now, Phoebe, remember, hey...
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,986
...they're just fulfilling
their Christmas...
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,625
- Destiny. Yes.
- Sure.
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:43,658
Okay.
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,999
Yikes. That one
doesn't look very fulfilled.
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,363
That's one of the old ones.
He's just taking it to the back.
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:53,003
You keep the old ones in the back?
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,504
That is so ageist.
00:07:56,576 --> 00:08:00,910
- We have to make room for the fresh ones.
- So, what happens to the old guys?
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:02,914
Well, they go into the chipper.
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,342
Why do I have a feeling
that's not as happy as it sounds?
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,195
These come in the shapes of your
favorite Christmas characters.
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:30,034
Santa, Rudolph and baby Jesus.
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,608
All right. I'll take a box
of the cream-filled Jesuses.
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:39,544
Wait a minute. One box? Come on. I'm
trying to send a little girl to Space Camp.
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:42,653
I'm putting you down for five boxes.
Chandler, what about you?
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:47,121
All right. Do you have any
coconut-flavored deities?
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:51,660
No, but there's coconut
in the Hanukkah Menorah-eos.
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:56,128
I'll tell you what. I'll put you down
for eight boxes. One for each night.
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:57,302
Mon?
00:08:57,503 --> 00:09:01,667
All right. I'll take one box of
the Mint Treasures. One, and that's it.
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:05,034
I started gaining weight after
I joined the Brown Birds. Remember?
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:08,645
Dad bought every one
of my boxes, and I ate them all.
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,482
No, Mon. Dad had to buy
every one of your boxes...
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,710
...because you ate them all.
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:21,788
But, you know, I'm sure that's
not gonna happen this time.
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:24,656
Why don't I put you down
for three of the Mint Treasures...
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,627
...and just a couple of the Rudolphs.
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,390
No.
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,497
Come on, now.
You know you want them.
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:36,004
Don't. Don't do this.
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:40,804
I'll tell you what, Mon.
I'll give you the first box for free.
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,709
Oh, God! I gotta go!
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:47,148
Come on. All the cool kids
are eating them.
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:52,456
When you have a second, I want to show
you why we don't just trap spiders...
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:55,354
...under coffee mugs
and leave them there.
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:03,068
I'm training to be better at a job
that I hate. My life officially sucks.
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,203
Wasn't this supposed
to be a temporary thing?
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:09,636
- I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff.
- Well, yeah. I'm still pursuing that.
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:12,643
How, exactly, are you pursuing that?
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:16,906
You know, other than sending out
resumes, like, what? Two years ago?
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,551
Well, I'm also sending out...
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:23,051
...good thoughts.
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,954
If you ask me,
as long as you got this job...
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:29,684
...you got nothing pushing you
to get another one.
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:32,227
You need The Fear.
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,092
- The Fear?
- He's right.
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,767
If you quit this job, you then...
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:39,028
...have motivation to go after
a job you really want.
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:40,865
Why are you still at a job you hate?
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:43,871
I mean, why don't you quit
and get The Fear?
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:47,477
Because I'm too afraid.
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:50,314
I don't know.
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:54,952
I mean, I would give anything to work
for a designer, you know, or a buyer.
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,679
I just don't want to be 30
and still work here.
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:02,759
Yeah, that'd be much worse than
being 28 and still working here.
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,827
- Rachel?
- Yeah?
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:09,331
Remind me to review with you which
pot is decaf and which is regular.
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:13,171
Can't I just look at the handles on them?
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:15,101
You would think.
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:19,734
Okay, fine. Gunther, you know what?
I am a terrible waitress.
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,948
Do you know why I'm a terrible
waitress? Because I don't care.
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,678
I don't care. I don't care which pot
is regular and which pot is decaf.
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,447
I don't care where the tray spot is.
I just don't care.
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:33,124
This is not what I want to do.
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:37,352
So I don't think I should do it anymore.
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,999
- I'm gonna give you my week's notice.
- What?
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,134
Gunther, I quit.
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:48,129
Does this mean we're gonna
have to start paying for coffee?
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,445
Okay, 12.
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:57,577
Twenty-two.
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,411
Eighteen.
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,190
What?
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,188
I spelled out "boobies."
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:15,699
Ross? Put me down for another box
of the Mint Treasures, okay?
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,392
Where are the Mint Treasures?
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:21,139
We're out. I sold them all.
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,164
What?
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,741
Monica, I'm cutting you off.
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,178
No.
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,042
No.
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,278
Just a couple more boxes.
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:37,678
It's no big deal, all right? I'm cool.
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:42,222
You gotta help me out
with a couple more boxes!
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:45,795
Mon, look at yourself.
You have cookie on your neck.
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,299
Oh, God!
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:53,438
- So how many you sold so far?
- Check this out.
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:57,905
- Five hundred and seventeen boxes.
- Oh, my God. How did you do that?
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,374
Okay, the other night
I was leaving the museum...
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:04,709
...just as Laser Floyd was letting out
of the planetarium.
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,847
Without even trying, I sold 50 boxes.
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,681
That's when it occurred to me.
The key to my success: The munchies.
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:18,192
So I started hitting
the NYU dorms around midnight.
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:23,299
I am selling cookies by the case.
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:27,097
They call me "Cookie Dude."
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:33,169
- Okay, but I'm not going to call you that.
- Okay.
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:37,847
Okay. Stop what you're doing. I need
envelope stuffers. I need stamp lickers...
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:41,781
- Hey, who did these resumes for you?
- Me. On my computer.
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:43,885
You sure used a large font.
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,590
Yeah. Well, "Waitress
at a Coffeehouse"...
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:50,455
...and "Cheer Squad Co-Captain"
only took up so much room.
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,562
Hey, that's funny!
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,462
You're funny, Chandler!
You're a funny guy!
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:58,465
You know what else is really funny?
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,662
Something else I might have said?
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:06,205
I don't know. I don't know. Weren't you
the guy that told me to quit my job...
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:09,643
...when I had absolutely
nothing else to do?
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:16,212
- Sweetie, calm down. It's gonna be okay.
- No, it's not gonna be okay, Ross.
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:20,324
Tomorrow is my last day,
and I don't have a lead.
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,994
Okay. You know what?
I'm just gonna call Gunther...
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,890
...and tell him I'm not quitting.
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:27,565
You don't want to give in to The Fear.
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:31,224
You and your stupid Fear.
I hate your Fear!
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,803
I would like to take
you and your Fear...
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:36,338
Hey! I got great news.
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,306
Run, Joey. Run for your life!
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:44,471
What? Rach, listen. Have you ever
heard of Fortunata Fashions?
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:45,650
No.
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:49,309
My old man's doing a plumbing job there,
and he heard they have an opening.
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:51,489
Want to see if he
can get you an interview?
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:55,558
Oh, my God, yes. I would love that.
That's so sweet, Joey.
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:56,887
Not a problem.
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,587
And now for the great news.
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,560
What, that wasn't the great news?
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:03,564
Only if you think
it's better than this.
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,227
Snow-in-a-Can!
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,805
I got it at work.
You want me to decorate the window?
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,839
Give it kind of a Christmas looky?
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,075
Christmas cookie?
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,685
Okay, and this one here's
a Douglas fir.
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:25,482
Now, it's a little more money,
but you get a nicer smell.
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:28,019
Looks good. I'll take it.
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,627
Wait, wait. No, no.
You don't want that one.
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:34,195
No. You can have
this cool brown one.
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,833
It's almost dead.
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:41,734
But that's why you have to buy it,
so that it can fulfill its Christmas destiny.
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:46,207
Otherwise, they're gonna throw
it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey.
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:50,109
Yeah, the trees that don't fulfill
their Christmas destiny...
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,648
...are thrown in the chipper.
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,750
I think I'm gonna look around
a little bit more.
00:15:57,556 --> 00:16:01,549
Pheebs. You gotta stop doing this.
I'm working on commission here.
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:05,425
Hey, guys. I'm here
to pick out my Christmas tree.
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:09,566
Well, look no further.
This one's yours.
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:14,829
Is this the one
that I threw out last year?
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:19,969
All right. You know what? Never mind.
Everybody wants to have a green one.
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:24,513
Sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to get so emotional. I guess it's just...
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,207
The holidays are just hard.
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:30,115
Oh, honey. Is that because
your mom died around Christmas?
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,654
I wasn't even thinking about that.
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:45,203
Hi, there.
How many did you sell?
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:50,238
I'm not gonna tell you. You're the
bad man who broke Sarah's leg.
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,901
Hey, now. That was an accident, okay?
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:55,341
You're a big scrud.
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,949
What's a scrud?
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,244
Why don't you look
in the mirror, scrud.
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:06,849
I don't have to.
I can just look at you.
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,420
All right, girls...
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:11,993
...and man.
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,662
Let's see your final tallies.
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,465
Debbie.
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:22,496
Three hundred and twenty-one
boxes of cookies. Very nice.
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,442
Not nice enough.
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,040
Charla.
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:29,180
Two hundred and seventy-eight.
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,312
Sorry, dear, but still good.
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:34,350
Good for a scrud.
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:38,555
Yes, Elizabeth.
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,889
Eight hundred and seventy-one.
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:44,062
That's crap!
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:49,790
Sister Brown Bird.
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,037
Good going.
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,537
Who's next?
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:03,172
- Hi, there.
- Hi.
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,841
And batting for Sarah...
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:08,208
...Ross Geller.
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:12,588
Eight hundred and seventy-two.
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:17,791
Although, it looks like you bought
an awful lot of cookies yourself.
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:21,090
That is because my doctor
says that I have...
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,667
...a very serious...
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,134
...nougat...
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,840
...deficiency.
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,775
Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:40,245
Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned
her uniform to her 19-year-old sister...
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:45,412
...who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz
and sold over 2000 boxes.
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:50,487
- Hey, how'd the interview go?
- I blew it.
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:53,130
I wouldn't have even hired me.
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:54,723
Come here, sweetie.
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,126
Listen...
00:18:56,502 --> 00:19:01,701
...you're gonna go on, like, a thousand
interviews before you get a job.
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:08,570
That's not how that
was supposed to come out.
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,805
This is just the worst Christmas ever.
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,479
You know what, Rach? Maybe you
should stay here at the coffeehouse.
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:18,679
I can't. It's too late. Terry already
hired that girl over there.
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,117
Look at her.
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:23,260
She's even got waitress experience.
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,421
Last night she was...
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,764
...teaching everybody
how to make...
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,330
...napkins...
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:32,536
...into...
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,967
That word was "swans."
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:45,882
Well, seeing that drunk Santa wet
himself really perked up my Christmas.
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:55,417
Oh, my God!
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,495
Merry Christmas!
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:01,227
You saved them!
You guys!
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,501
Oh, God, you're the best!
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,330
It's like Night of the
Living Dead Christmas Trees.
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:11,502
Hello.
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,735
Yeah, this is she.
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:17,775
You're kidding. You're kidding.
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,318
Thank you. I love you!
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,783
Sure, everybody loves a kidder.
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,615
I got the job!
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:27,053
That's great.
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:30,791
God bless us, everyone.
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:37,027
Here we go. Serving
my last cup of coffee.
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:45,534
There you go.
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,438
Enjoy.
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:53,180
- Should I tell her I ordered tea?
- No.
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,616
Excuse me, everyone.
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:59,118
This is my last night working here...
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,554
...and I just wanted to say...
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,593
...that I made some
really good friends here.
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,592
And it's just time to move on.
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:14,565
And no offense to everybody
who still works here...
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:18,174
...but you have no idea
how good it feels to say...
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,902
...that as of this moment...
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:25,914
...I will never have
to make coffee again.
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,882
Now, Mr. Kaplan Sr.
Likes his coffee strong.
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:32,488
So you're gonna use
two bags instead of one.
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:35,455
See. Now, pay attention,
because this part's tricky.
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:40,394
See, some people use filters
just once...
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,534
I'm sorry you didn't get to go
to Space Camp...
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:56,203
...and I'm hoping that maybe somehow
this may help make up for it. Okay?
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:58,246
Presenting...
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:02,114
...Sarah Tuddle's
Private Very Special Space Camp!
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,584
Really, Mr. Geller,
you don't have to do this.
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,694
Come on, here we go.
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:15,230
Stand by for mission countdown.
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:16,826
Ten, ten...
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:18,263
Nine, nine, nine...
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,993
Eight, eight, eight...
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:23,338
Okay, blast off.
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,652
I'm an alien. I'm an alien.
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,887
Oh, no! An asteroid!
