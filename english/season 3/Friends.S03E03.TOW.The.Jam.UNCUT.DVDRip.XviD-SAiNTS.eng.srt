00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:20,612
See, Joe, that's why your parents
told you not to jump on the bed!
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:27,825
The One With the Jam
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:13,266
Hey, look at me!
I'm making jam!
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,601
- I've been at it since 4 a.m.
- Where'd you get fruit at 4 a.m.?
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:20,778
Went down to the docks. Betcha
didn't know you can get it wholesale.
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,310
I didn't know there were docks.
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,980
- Hey.
- Hey.
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:28,484
Is it broken?
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:31,122
No, but I gotta wear this
for a couple weeks.
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:34,484
Did you tell the doctor you did it
jumping up and down on your bed?
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:38,560
No. I had a whole story
worked out, but then...
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:40,298
...Chandler sold me out.
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,991
I'm sorry, Joe. I didn't think
the doctor was gonna buy...
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:45,763
...that it just fell out of the socket.
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:49,304
What is this? Fruit?
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:53,807
Monica's making jam.
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:58,746
Oh, jam? I love jam! Hey, how come
we never have jam at our place?
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,145
Because the kids need new shoes.
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:06,255
I'm going into business. I'm sick and
tired of being depressed about Richard.
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:09,189
I needed a plan.
A plan to get over my man.
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,488
What's the opposite of man? Jam!
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,764
Oh, Joey, don't! It's way too hot!
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,778
This'll just be my batch.
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,797
That's it. No.
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,522
Hey, you, J. Crew guy...
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,564
Why have you been following me?
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:51,032
All week long,
everywhere I look, there's you.
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:52,903
You wouldn't return my calls.
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,767
- You sent back my letters.
- What?
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:57,272
One more chance, Ursula. Please.
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,074
Oh, well, this is awkward.
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:07,783
Yeah, because you want Ursula,
and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters.
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:10,646
Seriously.
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,524
That's great.
I'm stalking the wrong woman.
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:16,922
I am such a dingus!
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,431
Oh, you're not a dingus.
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:23,363
I just want you to know
I didn't used to be like this.
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,004
Before I met your sister,
I was like this normal guy...
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,037
...who sold beepers
and cellular phones.
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,477
I mean, look,
it's not your fault, you know.
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:37,378
I mean, this is just what she
does to guys, okay? So just...
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:39,478
Well, thanks.
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,319
Wait. You know what?
I got a little story.
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:46,922
When I was in junior high, I went through
a period where I thought I was a witch.
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:49,026
And there was this guidance
counselor who...
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,527
...said something that
I think will help you a lot.
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:56,134
He said, "Okay, you're not a witch.
You're just an average student."
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:59,834
- See what I'm saying?
- Not really.
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,439
Well, get over it.
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:09,910
So... I mean, you just, you seem like
a really nice guy. You know, and just...
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:12,175
Don't be so hard on yourself, okay?
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:16,582
You're right. I know you're right.
And thanks for being so nice.
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:18,924
Here.
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,986
Thanks a lot.
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,184
Do you want to get a cup of coffee?
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:25,660
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,729
You don't have
to walk behind me anymore.
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:35,169
- Mon?
- Mon?
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:39,843
"Gone for more jars. Back later.
Monica Geller."
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,143
- Wait a minute. Look!
- What?
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:44,976
- Look. Look. Look.
- What? What? What?
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:47,379
It's an empty apartment.
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:50,646
We're all alone
in an empty apartment.
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:54,384
Oh, honey, come on. I have
to be at work in, like, ten minutes.
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:59,426
All right. Well, it's not like
I'm employee of the year or anything.
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:05,728
There it is!
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:07,906
Oh, that's what you're talking about.
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:10,200
- Hey.
- Hey.
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,002
Do I look fat?
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:14,071
- No.
- No.
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,271
Okay. I accept that.
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,315
When Janice asked me and I said no,
she took that to mean...
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,817
...that I was calling her a cow.
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:25,422
Okay. Walk us through it, honey.
Walk us through it.
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:30,255
Okay, well, Janice said, "Hi. Do I look
fat today?" And I looked at her...
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:33,990
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. You looked at her?
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,031
You never look.
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:43,368
You just answer. It's like a reflex.
"Do I look fat?" "No."
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,813
"Is she prettier than I am?"
"No."
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,006
- Does size matter?
- No!
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:52,946
And it works both ways.
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:59,216
Okay, so you both
just know this stuff?
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:02,758
You know, after about 30 or 40 fights,
you kind of catch on.
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,720
Okay. For instance:
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:10,631
Let's say, Janice is coming back from
a trip and she gives you two options.
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,668
Option number one: She'll take
a cab home from the airport.
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:17,775
Or option two: You can meet her
at baggage claim. What do you do?
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:21,140
- That's easy. Baggage claim.
- Wrong! Now you're single.
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:26,748
It's actually secret
option number three.
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:30,417
You meet her at the gate.
That way she knows you love her.
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:32,615
Okay, this is good.
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:36,693
All right, listen. I have one.
Janice likes to cuddle...
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,364
...at night,
which I'm all for.
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:43,160
But when you want to go to sleep,
you want some space.
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:46,202
So how do I tell her that without...
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:49,633
...you know, accidentally
calling her fat or something?
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:54,445
Oh, honey. I'm sorry. We can't help you
there, because we're cuddly sleepers.
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:59,306
Okay. I'm late for work. All right.
Are you guys going to come down?
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,579
- Yeah. I'm right behind you.
- Okay. Good luck, Chandler.
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,017
- Thank you.
- Bye, sweetie.
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:05,383
Bye, honey.
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,651
Okay, the sleeping thing.
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,889
Very tricky business,
but there is something you can do.
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,432
- I thought you were "cuddly sleepers."
- No.
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:20,862
No. Not cuddly.
Not me. Just her.
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:23,234
I'm like you.
I need the room.
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:24,838
Okay, come here.
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:32,178
- Okay. You're in bed.
- Yeah.
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:38,089
- I'm gonna use the cushion.
- Yeah.
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:43,393
Okay. You're in bed.
She's over on your side, cuddling.
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:46,688
Now, you wait for her to drift off...
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,191
...and then you hug her...
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:54,329
...and roll her over
to her side of the bed.
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,365
And then you...
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,835
...roll away.
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,376
Hug for her.
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:08,579
Roll for you.
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:11,847
Okay. The old "hug and roll."
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,153
- Okay. One question.
- Shoot.
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,056
You're pretending
the pillow's a girl, right?
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:24,060
Remember when you were a kid and your
mom would drop you off at the movies...
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,467
...with a jar of jam
and a little spoon?
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,741
You're so pretty.
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,613
- Hi!
- Hey, Phoebe!
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:42,652
Hey, you know that guy who's been
following me? I talked to him today.
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,516
You talked to him?
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,988
Are you crazy?
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:51,358
Okay. First, I'm not crazy.
And second, say it, don't spray it.
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:56,133
Anyway, his name is Malcolm,
and he wasn't following me.
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,167
I mean, he was, but just
because he thought I was Ursula.
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:05,099
That's why he couldn't just
come up and talk to me.
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:08,778
Because of the restraining order.
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,008
Not feeling better about Malcolm.
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:16,755
No, no, no. He's not a kook.
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:20,790
He's just this, like, very passionate,
incredibly romantic guy...
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:23,757
...that just got, like, a teensy bit
carried away, you know.
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:27,160
And we just get along really well,
and he is so cute.
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:33,297
Oh, my God! You've got a crush
on your sister's stalker.
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:36,540
I'm just going to help him.
You know. Get de-Ursula-ized.
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,677
Like, you know. Like I did for Joey
after he went out with her.
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,210
I didn't stalk her, I mean...
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,873
- I asked for the news, not the weather.
- Sorry.
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,020
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Mon.
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:52,586
Joey, this is for you.
It's blackberry currant.
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:01,092
Joe, I got to ask.
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:04,132
The girl from the Xerox place,
buck naked...
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,331
...or a big tub of jam?
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,939
Put your hands together.
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,582
Joey, take your time with that.
That's my last batch.
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:19,818
No more jam?
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,947
Well, what happened
to your jam plan?
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:26,716
I figured out I'd need to charge
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:30,191
So I've got a new plan now.
Babies.
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,864
Well, you're gonna
need much bigger jars.
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:39,629
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about me having a baby.
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:42,136
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:45,777
The great thing about the jam plan
was I was taking control of my life.
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:49,573
So I asked myself, "What is the most
important thing to me in the world?"
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:51,909
And that's when I came up
with the baby plan.
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:54,518
Aren't you forgetting something?
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:57,851
What is that guy's name?
Dad!
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:03,284
It took me 28 years to find one man
that I wanted to spend my life with.
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:07,625
If I have to wait another 28 years,
then I'll be 56 before I can have a baby.
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,732
And that's just stupid.
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,331
That's what's stupid?
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:20,140
I don't need an actual man.
Just a couple of his best swimmers.
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:24,149
And there are places that
you can go to get that stuff.
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,443
Down to the docks again?
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:39,164
Night-night, Bing-a-ling.
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,157
Night-night...
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,229
...Janice.
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:51,272
Look at all that room on her side!
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:53,377
You could fit a giant
penguin over there.
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:56,710
That'd be weird, though.
00:11:58,684 --> 00:11:59,946
Hug and roll time.
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,484
I'm hugging. I'm hugging.
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:05,053
You're rolling, and...
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,282
Yes! Freedom!
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,994
Except for this arm!
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:13,659
I'm stuck. Stuck arm.
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:18,060
Okay. Time for the old tablecloth
trick. One fluid motion.
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,238
Quick like a cat. Quick like a cat.
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:23,306
And one, two...
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,306
...three!
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:35,249
Here's my binoculars.
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:40,320
Great. You're doing great, you know.
Real strong. Going strong. Keep going.
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,822
These are my night-vision goggles.
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:48,394
This is the book I pretend to read
when I'm watching her in the park.
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:53,601
And these are Mad Libs.
They're just for fun.
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,296
What's this?
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:59,535
This is the log I kept,
recording her every movement.
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,576
You want to hear something from it?
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,646
Not even a little bit.
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:05,951
It's about you.
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,915
Oh. Okay, then.
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,888
"I met Phoebe today.
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:19,363
She was really nice to me
even though I'm such a loser.
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:22,796
And when I was walking home,
I thought about her a lot.
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:26,094
It was weird, but kind of cool."
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:28,262
Good.
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,667
So, what were you thinking?
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:35,438
I was thinking what
it'd be like to kiss you.
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,012
- Really?
- No.
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:43,846
See, that's just something I said now
so that maybe I could kiss you.
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:46,323
Oh, okay.
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,292
No, it's all right.
I just had a jar of mustard.
00:13:56,468 --> 00:14:01,667
Okay. Sperm donor number 03815,
come on down!
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:04,535
Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds.
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:07,769
And he describes himself
as a male Geena Davis.
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,414
You mean there's
more than one of us?
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:15,118
You can't do this, Mon.
All right. If you do this, I'm gonna...
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:18,757
- You're gonna what?
- I'm gonna tell Mom.
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,689
Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right.
I love you, but you're crazy.
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:25,489
Why? Why is this crazy?
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:28,458
- So this isn't the ideal way...
- Oh, it's not the ideal...?
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,530
Lips moving. Still talking.
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,795
It may not be ideal, but...
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,868
...I'm so ready.
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:38,602
I see the way
Ben looks at you.
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,770
It makes me ache, you know?
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:45,644
Check it out! Jam crackers!
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,447
Okay. All right, how's this?
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:53,519
Twenty-seven, Italian-American guy.
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,350
He's an actor.
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,288
Born in Queens.
00:14:57,596 --> 00:15:00,759
Wow! Big family.
Seven sisters...
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:05,464
...and he's the only boy.
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:11,870
Oh, my God! Under personal comments:
"New York Knicks rule."
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,567
Yeah, the Knicks rule!
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,574
Joey, this is you!
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:21,980
Let me see.
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:24,949
Oh, right.
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,987
When did you go to a sperm bank?
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:30,957
Oh, right after I did
that sex study down at NYU.
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:33,790
Hey, remember that sweater
I gave you for your birthday?
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,467
And that's how you bought it?
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:40,433
No. That's what I was wearing
when I donated.
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:47,201
I'm kind of surprised there's
any of my boys left.
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:51,281
Honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean,
I've got an actual rocket scientist here.
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:53,610
Maybe I should call this place
and get them...
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:55,844
...to put my Days of our Lives
gig on here.
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,784
Juice this puppy up a little.
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:01,282
- Hey.
- Hey!
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:02,755
How's the maniac?
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:06,060
He's yummy.
We did a little kissing.
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:09,159
- Phoebe, what are you doing?
- Oh, no.
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:14,362
No. No. You know what? He's not into
that stuff anymore. He quit for me.
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:19,772
This guy has been obsessed with your
sister for God knows how long, okay.
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,038
You don't just give up
something like that.
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:25,876
So look, he gave me his night-vision
goggles and everything. So...
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:30,578
You're taking the word of a guy
who has night-vision goggles?
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:34,623
What? He's not still following her.
You think he's still following her?
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,819
Pheebs. Wake up and smell
the restraining order.
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:41,232
What are you saying I should do?
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:44,459
I think that if you really like this
guy, you should just trust him.
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,796
Thank you, Monica.
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,473
Or you could follow him
and see where he goes.
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,142
Oh, that's what I would do.
Forget mine.
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,376
Oh, my God! What happened?
00:16:55,581 --> 00:17:00,314
Oh, God. Crazy Chandler.
He spun me off the bed.
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,352
Wow! Spinning.
That sounds like fun.
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:06,924
I wish.
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:11,822
No. You know, he was just
trying Ross' "hug and roll" thing.
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,355
Ross' what?
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:20,004
You know. Like where he hugs you
and then kind of rolls you away, and...
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,031
Oh...
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:25,437
...my...
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:27,805
...God!
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:01,809
- Phoebe?
- Yes? Yes!
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:04,704
What are you doing?
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,148
Oh, I was just here
looking for my...
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:11,114
Part of an old sandwich.
Here it is!
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,119
Were you following me?
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:17,186
Perhaps.
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,724
Yes. Yes. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:24,059
I was just afraid that you
were still hung up on my sister.
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,703
So you spied on me.
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:29,203
I can't believe
you don't trust me.
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:39,373
Oh, well, what do you know?
There goes my identical twin sister!
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:42,245
Just walking along, looking like me.
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:47,591
Well, is this like a freakish coincidence,
or did you know that she takes this train?
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:52,963
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I tried to stop, but I couldn't.
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,396
I'm so pathetic.
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:59,537
No. No, it's not your fault.
You know, it's partly my fault.
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:02,298
It's 'cause I made
you quit cold turkey.
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:07,538
Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you
anymore because you're, you know...
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:08,973
Wow!
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:15,181
But I will definitely, definitely
help you get over my sister. Okay?
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:18,387
Stalk me for a while, huh?
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:22,625
Yeah, and I'll be like an Ursula patch.
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:25,654
- I don't know.
- Yeah! Just...
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,957
Okay. Look, I'm going!
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,263
Come on.
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:34,160
I'm behind the pillar.
Which way am I gonna go?
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,134
- Hey.
- Hey.
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,674
- Where you going?
- To the bank.
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:42,210
Sperm or regular?
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,548
Sperm.
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:49,720
- So you're really doing it, huh?
- Oh, yeah. I picked a guy. 37135.
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,082
Sounds nice.
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,225
I'd say so. He's got
brown hair and green eyes.
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:55,984
No kidding?
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,190
- What?
- I figured you would have picked a blond.
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:01,823
- Really? Why?
- I don't know.
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:06,835
I always pictured you ending up with a
tall, smart, blond guy with a name like...
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:08,061
...Hoyt.
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:10,475
Hoyt?
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:11,973
It's a name. Yeah.
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:17,740
I saw you in this, you know,
this great house with a big pool.
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:20,611
Yeah? Is he a swimmer?
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:22,651
He's got the body for it.
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,950
I like that.
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,691
What?
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,487
You have one of those signs that says:
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:34,825
"We don't swim in your toilet,
so don't pee in our pool." You know.
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:38,400
- We do not have one of those signs.
- Sure, you do. It was a gift from me.
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,868
Oh! And you have these three great kids.
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,340
- Two girls and a boy?
- Yeah!
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,843
And they wear those little water wings,
you know...
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:51,015
...and they're running around
on the deck.
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:54,014
And then Hoyt wraps this big towel
around all three of them.
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:55,982
Sure.
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:04,523
But, hey, you know,
this way sounds good too.
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,596
Yeah.
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:12,797
Oh, Monica.
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:22,308
Wow! This guy's an astronaut?
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:26,576
That would have been cool...
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,685
...for like a day.
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:39,697
She'll be back at 5.
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,695
Five!
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,940
I called the sperm bank today.
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:53,338
They haven't sold a single unit
of Tribbiani.
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:55,403
Nobody wants my product.
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:59,508
I mean, I don't get it, you know.
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:04,983
I mean...
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:07,789
Maybe if they met me in person.
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:12,256
Honey, you got a little thing on your...
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:16,968
Get it?
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,831
Yeah.
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,471
Hello.
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:26,441
Hello.
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:31,312
Okay.
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:36,484
Chan, can I talk to you
for a second?
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,713
Sure. What's up?
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:41,950
Just one additional
relationship thought.
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,924
Something you're probably
already familiar with.
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,222
Women talk.
