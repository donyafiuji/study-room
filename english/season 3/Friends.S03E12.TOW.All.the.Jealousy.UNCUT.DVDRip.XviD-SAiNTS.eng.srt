00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:06,237
- Does everybody hate these shoes?
- Yeah.
00:00:06,706 --> 00:00:10,608
But don't worry. Nobody's gonna focus
on that if you wear that towel-dress.
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:13,479
Tell him.
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:17,911
It's her first day at this new job.
You're not supposed to start with her.
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:21,409
All right, I suppose I can wait a day.
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:24,351
- What are you doing Friday?
- Why?
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:27,354
I need you at a bachelor party
for my weird cousin, Albert.
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,289
You know, he's the botanist?
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:30,758
Oh, God!
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:32,988
Botanists are such geeks.
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:36,096
Is that a dinosaur tie?
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,133
Morning!
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,943
Rach, I'm here with the purses!
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:50,275
It must take you forever
to find your keys.
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:52,014
Thank you, Pheebs.
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:55,186
You're welcome. Please want
the one with the turtles.
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,982
No, turtles scare me.
I don't need that today.
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,884
Honey, just relax.
It's gonna be fine.
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:04,755
Why don't I come down there,
and I'll take you to lunch?
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:07,626
Honey, thank you!
But Mark's taking me out.
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:11,798
Mark? Is that the same Mark
that helped you get the job?
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:15,406
Yeah, it's kind of like a "good luck
on your first day" sort of thing.
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:16,802
Is this a lunch box?
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:20,279
No, it's a purse.
And there's a thermos in it.
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:25,281
- So can you make it on Friday?
- What?
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:28,079
Yeah, I think so.
Why am I invited to this again?
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:29,880
Apparently, Albert has no friends.
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:32,057
He's very excited about
the bachelor party.
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:35,591
I think, actually, he's only getting
married so he can see a stripper.
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:40,821
A stripper at a bachelor party.
That is so cliche.
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,762
Why don't you guys get a magician?
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:48,270
Well, if a magician can open my beer
with his butt cheeks, then all right.
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:56,380
The One With All the Jealousy
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:40,818
She's having lunch with him?
Lunch with him?
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:43,791
You should've seen the hug he gave her
when she got the job!
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:46,896
And he's really good-looking.
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:50,601
- What am I gonna do?
- You don't do anything.
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,428
Keep it inside.
Learn how to hide your feelings.
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,365
Don't cry out loud.
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,644
Guess who has an audition
for a Broadway musical?
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,307
I wanna say you, but it seems like
such an easy answer.
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,720
It is me! It's a musical version
of A Tale of Two Cities.
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,448
So I think I'm gonna sing
"New York, New York"...
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:17,389
...and "I Left My Heart
in San Francisco."
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:23,830
Joey, I don't think
you get to pick the cities.
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:27,698
- What?
- Mr. Dickens gets to pick them.
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,773
Who?
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,843
I'll get you the Cliff Notes.
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,513
- The what?
- The abridgment.
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,747
Okay.
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,082
The what?
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:48,817
Then the style number...
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:53,490
...the invoice number
and the shipping date.
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,725
Good. Any questions so far?
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:57,929
What kind of discount do we get?
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:02,935
- Twenty percent.
- I love this job!
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,574
- My first call!
- Here, let me.
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,378
Rachel Greene's line.
How may I help you?
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,776
Hi, is Rachel there?
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,953
- And who may I say is calling?
- This is Ross.
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:15,177
Ross of...?
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:18,615
Of Ross and Rachel.
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,952
Hi, it's Mark.
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,060
- Hey, Mark.
- Hey.
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:26,059
Hold on a second.
It's Ross.
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,529
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,301
What's Mark doing
answering your phone?
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,299
Oh, he's just goofing around.
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,575
Oh, that's funny.
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:40,669
Why isn't he goofing around
in his own office?
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,907
This is his office too. I told you,
we're Joanna's two assistants.
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,348
Why does Joanna need two assistants?
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,655
How lazy is she?
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,950
Oh, my God! What did I just do?
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:55,353
I think I just shipped 3000 bras
to Personnel!
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,289
Honey, I gotta go!
Mark, I need you!
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,795
Okay! Bye-bye!
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:02,861
Ross!
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,560
I'm sorry, sweetie.
I was just trying to...
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,737
I was dialing another number.
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:24,951
All right, I just got changed in 30
seconds so you could be alone with him.
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,386
You better go for it.
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:28,651
Please. I'm not going for anything.
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:30,294
Well, if you don't, I will.
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,190
Would you please go?
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,766
'Night, Mon.
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:38,093
'Night, Julio.
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,576
Julio, someone left their book here.
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:54,314
Actually, that is mine.
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,318
What are you reading?
00:05:56,622 --> 00:06:00,991
Flowers of Evil, by Baudelaire.
Have you read it?
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,718
Have I read it?
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,254
No. Are you enjoying it?
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,598
I thought that I would,
but the translation's no good.
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,701
You're a poet,
and you don't know it.
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,271
Actually, I...
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:20,839
I am a poet.
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:25,440
So you do know it.
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,882
So, what kind of things
do you write about?
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:36,090
Things that move me:
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,530
The shadow of a tree...
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:40,860
...a child laughing...
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:43,993
...or this lip.
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:45,671
Mine?
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:47,798
Right here?
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:53,909
I could write an epic poem
about this lip.
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,746
How would that go?
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,760
Well, it didn't rhyme...
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:15,990
...but I liked it.
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,619
Lovely.
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,051
Just lovely.
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,823
Really? Thanks.
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:43,518
Listen, Joey. We definitely want
to see you for the callback on Saturday.
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:44,987
Excellent!
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:46,822
- I'll be there.
- Okay.
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,569
And listen, don't forget to bring
your jazz shoes for the dance audition.
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:58,075
My agent said that
it wasn't a dancing part.
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:01,041
Joey, all the roles gotta dance a little.
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:04,407
Believe me, with your dance background,
it'll be a piece of cake.
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:07,882
"Three years of modern dance
with Twyla Tharp"?
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,819
"Five years with
the American Ballet Theatre"?
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,325
Hey, everybody lies
on their resume, okay?
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:19,963
I wasn't one of
the Zoom kids either.
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:23,263
Well, can you, like, dance at all?
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,595
Yeah, I can dance.
You know...
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,948
Oh, no, no, no, no.
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:39,611
What is that?
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:43,714
Sure, it looks stupid now.
There's no music playing.
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,652
I have to get that.
But, no, no.
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,793
Hello. Hi.
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:57,869
Yeah, listen, I'm in need of a stripper,
and I was told that you do that.
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:04,734
Let me ask you this. What do you do
for the extra hundred?
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:09,436
So would I have to provide the grapes?
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:11,048
Hi.
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,776
How was last night
with Julio, senorita?
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:18,580
It so was amazing. He's so sexy and
smart, which makes him even sexier.
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,521
I gotta tell you this. Last night,
we were fooling around...
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,696
...and all of a sudden he stops
to write a poem.
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,500
Get out! I couldn't stop
if a meteor hit me.
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:35,568
Okay, we have our stripper,
a Miss Crystal Chandelier.
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:39,176
Sure, you name a kid that, what do you
expect them to grow up to be?
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:44,242
Anyway, when he left, he forgot
to take the poem with him.
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:49,011
Now, I am totally dense about poetry,
but I think this is pretty good.
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:52,156
Check it out. Read it.
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:55,718
"The Empty Vase."
Translucent beauty...
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,122
To yourself.
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,992
You know what? That's pretty good.
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:04,533
Good. I think so too.
Phoebe?
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:05,829
Yeah.
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,835
Great! I'm so glad you guys like it!
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,770
- All right, I gotta go to work.
- Hold on. I'm not done.
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,378
All right, give it back when
you're through.
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,111
- See you guys.
- Bye-bye.
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,980
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Poor Monica!
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,584
What? What? What?
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,653
What? He was with her
when he wrote this poem!
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:27,189
Look! My vessel so lovely,
with nothing inside?
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:30,123
Now that I've touched you,
you seem emptier still?
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:33,422
He thinks Monica's empty.
She's the empty vase!
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,863
- Vase, vase?
- Monica's not an empty vase.
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:38,036
You think vase?
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,368
- You really think that's what he meant?
- Totally.
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:44,134
Oh, God!
And she seems so happy too.
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,334
Done.
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,947
What happened?
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,275
Joey, what do you think
this poem means?
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,311
Monica's the vase, right?
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,553
You are such a mystery to me.
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,599
Do you have the Ralph Lauren file?
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:14,500
Oh, yeah, sure! It's right...
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,839
What's that?
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,276
It's from Ross. It's a Love Bug.
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:27,241
Somebody wants people to know
you have a boyfriend.
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:30,388
No, that's not what he's doing.
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:31,886
He's just really romantic.
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,990
- Excuse me. Are you Rachel Greene?
- Yes.
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:39,364
One, two, three.
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:42,534
Congratulations on your first week
At your brand-new job
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:45,328
It won't be long
Before you're the boss
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:49,364
And you know who will be there
To support you
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:50,939
Your one and only boyfriend
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:52,710
It's nice to have a boyfriend!
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:56,846
Your loyal, loving boyfriend, Ross!
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,985
I'm hurt!
I'm actually hurt...
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:12,187
...that you'd think I'd send you any of
those things out of anything but love.
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,559
Hurt! Hurt!
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,394
All right, Ross. I get it. You're hurt!
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,764
Can't a guy send
a barbershop quartet...
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,974
...to his girlfriend's office anymore?
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:27,071
Oh, please!
Ross, it was so obvious.
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,679
It was like you were
marking your territory.
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:34,045
You might as well have just come in
and peed all around my desk!
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,646
I would never do that.
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,117
Look, I know what's going
on here, okay?
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:46,661
Mark explained it all to me.
He said this is what you guys do.
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:50,700
Yeah, well, if Mark said that,
then Mark's an idiot.
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,200
Mark's a genius.
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:54,429
Why? How?
How is he a genius?
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,367
Don't you see what's happening here?
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:59,703
Instead of hitting on her right away,
he's becoming her confidante.
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:04,144
Now he's gonna be the guy she goes to,
to complain about you.
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,586
You okay over there?
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:11,323
I tried taking a dance class today
to get ready for this callback tomorrow.
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:14,357
- How'd it go?
- Knocked over a girl.
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:18,558
Good work. Can we get back to the
Mark thing? What am I gonna do?
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:20,664
Why don't you send her a musical bug?
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,162
No, you already did that.
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,898
All right, you're gonna have
to go there yourself now.
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,971
- Make a few surprise visits.
- I don't know, you guys.
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:33,473
Fine, don't do anything.
Just sit and talk to us.
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:36,340
Meanwhile, she is talking
to him about you.
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,107
And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive.
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:42,378
She starts thinking, "Maybe this is the
guy for me because he understands me."
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,647
And before you know it,
she's with him.
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:47,985
And you'll be all, "Oh, man!"
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,923
And he'll be all, "Yes!"
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,792
And us, we'll be like, "Oh, dude!"
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,327
And pretty soon you'll be like:
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:02,098
"Hi."
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:06,870
And, "Well, I can't go.
Rachel and Mark might be there."
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,610
And we'll be like, "Man, get over it!
It's been four years!"
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:16,380
He paints quite a picture, doesn't he?
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,756
Here's the Shelley Segal stuff
for December.
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:24,361
Wait, I've got something for you.
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:26,929
- Mark.
- It's okay. Rachel knows.
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,099
Yeah, but even so.
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:32,628
I can't help it.
I'm just crazy about you.
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:35,873
Oh, that is so sweet!
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:40,802
I know I'm Mr. Inappropriate today,
but it's just so tough.
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:44,244
I mean, I see you walking around,
and I want to touch you and hold you.
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,217
Come on, no one's around.
Just kiss me.
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,614
All right, that's it!
Get off of her!
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:50,982
What is going on?
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,988
What's going on?
I'll tell you what's going on!
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:56,093
Ross!
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:05,162
I have been down in your store
for 20 minutes, trying to get a tie.
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,764
What do I have to do
to get some service?
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:13,809
Hi, Rach.
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:25,517
Joey? Joey Tribbiani?
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:30,792
Joey, I've got a problem.
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,121
I just got a call
from my dance captain.
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,492
He's having a relationship crisis
and can't get out of Long Island.
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,795
So does that mean the audition's off?
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:42,371
Listen, Joey. Seeing as you've got
the most experience...
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:45,600
...I want you to take these dancers
and teach them the combination.
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:48,902
What?
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:52,948
Joey, come on. It's easy.
You know, it's hand, hand...
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:54,881
...head, head...
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:59,615
...up, pas de bourree, pas de bourree,
big turn here, rond de jambe.
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:01,916
Slide, step, step...
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,755
...and jazz hands!
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:10,460
It's steppity-step and jazz hands.
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:12,064
Have fun.
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,736
Bye.
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,173
- Hey.
- Hey.
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:20,743
What are you wrapping?
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:23,374
Look what I got Julio.
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:27,778
Yeah, it's a vase.
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,888
Yeah, just like the one in the poem.
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,591
Not exactly like
the one in the poem.
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,727
What do you mean?
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:39,162
Remember how you said you were
really dense about poetry?
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,864
So I'm just an empty vase?
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:49,631
What?
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,310
So, I don't read as many
important books as you do.
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:56,948
And I don't write trick poems
that aren't actually what they seem.
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,617
And you know what?
I get excited about stupid stuff...
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:02,184
...like when my People magazine
comes on Saturday...
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:05,084
...and the new
Hold Everything catalog.
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:09,556
But that doesn't mean I'm empty. I care
about things, like friends and family.
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:13,698
You have no right to make that kind of
judgment! You don't even know me!
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,426
The poem is not about you.
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,599
- What?
- "The Empty Vase" is not about you.
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:26,300
My baby preciosa, you make me so sad
that you would think this.
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,748
I'm sorry. It's...
My friend Phoebe said...
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:35,386
No, it's...
It's about all women.
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,321
Well, all American women.
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:43,555
You feel better now?
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,835
All right, let's do it.
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:12,683
What was that?
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,993
I know. It's the best
I could get out of them.
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:19,162
Well, people!
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,558
People, people, people!
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:26,936
Let's try it again. And this time,
let's everybody watch Joey.
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:29,997
Show them how it's done.
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,982
Count it off, Mack.
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:52,490
Did you have fun at
the bachelor party last night?
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:55,724
Yeah, look what I got!
See, she's fully dressed, right?
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:59,401
And then you click it,
and she's naked!
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,868
And then you click it again,
and she's dressed.
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,408
She's a business woman,
walking down the street.
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,206
She's window shopping,
and she's naked!
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:17,880
Hi.
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,285
Hello.
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,058
You know what? I'm gonna spend
some alone time with the pen.
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,900
I'm sorry. I was an idiot.
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:37,806
A big idiot.
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:39,441
A big idiot.
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:45,183
It's just you have to realize this whole
Mark thing is really hard for me.
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:49,118
Honey, why is it hard? We've
been together for almost a year now.
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,589
Well, I was with Carol
for, like, eight years.
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,259
And I lost her.
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:59,396
And now, if it's possible,
I think I love you even more.
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:03,233
So it's hard for me
to believe I'm not gonna...
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:07,234
...well, that someone else isn't
gonna take you away.
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:10,101
Let it be me. Let it be me!
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:18,382
Honey, that's very sweet.
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:22,417
It just seems to me, though,
that if two people love each other...
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:25,088
...and trust each other, like we do...
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:27,417
...there's no reason to be jealous.
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,834
I gotta get going.
Bye, Chandler.
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:43,136
Okay, Ross, this pen's getting kind of
boring. Can you pick me up some porn?
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:47,111
Where you going?
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:50,076
I've gotta go pick up Ben.
We got a play-date this afternoon.
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:51,840
With who?
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:54,642
Just this woman I met
last night at the party.
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:56,581
There was a woman at...?
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,082
The stripper?
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:05,285
- Yeah.
- You have a play-date with a stripper?
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,497
Man, I gotta get a kid!
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:19,333
Yeah, we started talking
after she did her thing...
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:21,910
...and it turns out she's got a boy
about Ben's age.
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:25,140
So we're gonna take the kids
to a Gymboree class.
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:27,876
- Is that okay?
- Sure. Is she married?
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:29,916
No.
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,327
Are you jealous?
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:41,564
No, I just don't see why she has
to play with you. That's all.
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:47,330
I mean, doesn't she, you know, have any
other stripper-mom friends of her own?
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:52,403
You are totally jealous!
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:56,074
I'm not jealous, all right.
This is about...
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:01,043
...people feeling certain things...
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:02,877
...you know, about...
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:06,853
...strippers. And, you know...
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,251
I love you too.
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:09,761
Bye.
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:11,593
Wait, wait, wait!
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,458
What?
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:29,577
Well, there's a kiss he won't forget
for a few hours.
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:34,582
Either that or you just turned him on
and sent him to a stripper.
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:40,957
All right, I'm jealous.
I'm jealous!
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:45,823
"Oh, no. Chandler, please don't.
No, I beg of you to not..."
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,503
Is there a Julio here?
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,272
I am Julio.
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:57,474
Mr. Pretentious
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,077
You think there's no one finer
Your poems are unpublished
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:03,242
And you work in a diner
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:07,849
You're no God's gift to women
That's all in your head
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:11,115
- You are just a butt-munch
- No one likes a butt-munch!
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:15,521
And you're also bad in bed
