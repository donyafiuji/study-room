00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:05,399
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,032
Say, Rachel...
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:11,333
...I was wondering if you'd like to
go to a movie with me sometime...
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:13,102
...as my lover.
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:17,474
Too out there.
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,619
Maybe you'd just like to get
something to eat with me sometime...
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:23,317
...as my lover.
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:27,082
- Hi.
- Hi.
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:28,658
All right, let's go shopping.
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:32,263
I got a positive balance on my credit card
I want to use before Citibank goes under.
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:34,899
Good idea. Good idea.
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:38,337
Before we go, you know,
there's something I need to say.
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:41,302
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,505
I've kind of had this crush on you.
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:50,510
But since you were with Ross,
I didn't do anything about it.
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:54,312
But now that you're not, I'd really
like to ask you out sometime.
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:57,348
So that's what I'm doing...
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,422
...now.
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:04,194
Wow.
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:16,273
I dropped a cup.
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:23,813
The One With the Tiny T-Shirt
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:07,956
You know, that's why within
a few years, voice recognition...
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:10,752
...is gonna be pretty much
standard on any computer.
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:15,458
You know, so you could be, like,
"Wash my car." "Clean my room."
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:19,603
It won't be able to do any of those things,
but it'll understand what you're saying.
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:24,209
Wow. Would it be able to recognize
my voice if I talked like this?
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,038
Oh, yeah. It'll understand you,
but it's gonna make fun of you.
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:31,478
Oh, this was so great.
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:33,413
Yeah, it was.
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:36,552
All right, then.
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:38,756
Bye.
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,293
Hello, people who do not live here.
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,869
I gave you a key for emergencies.
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:56,132
We were out of Doritos.
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,440
Hey, how'd the date go
with Mr. Millionaire?
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,740
Mr. Millionaire.
New, from Snooty Playthings.
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,245
Third wife sold separately.
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:10,388
He's great. I mean, we have
such a good time together.
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,618
He's so funny and so sweet.
And I'm not attracted to him at all!
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,825
- Still?
- No.
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:21,694
It's driving me crazy. In every
other way, he's the perfect guy.
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:25,928
He has everything.
Plus, he actually has everything.
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,702
Life-sized Imperial Stormtroopers
from Sharper Image?
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:31,376
Two.
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:34,142
Wow. Can Joey and I put
them on and fight?
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:40,643
Oh, Mommy! Oh, Daddy!
I am a big old baddy
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:45,313
Oh, Mommy! Oh, Daddy!
I am a big old baddy
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,392
I guess he must've gotten
the part in that play.
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:57,366
Either that, or Gloria Estefan was right.
Eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:06,073
- Joe, how's it going?
- Good.
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:12,150
- Hey.
- Hi.
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,579
So you're playing Adrienne?
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:17,312
Yes. Are you one
of the retarded cousins?
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:23,084
No. I'm playing your husband, Victor.
I'm Joey Tribbiani.
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:25,694
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Kate Miller.
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:35,166
So the play's pretty great, huh?
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,809
Oh, yeah.
I love Jennifer Banberry's work.
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,603
She's so incisive when it comes...
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:42,212
...to deconstructing
the psyche of the middle class.
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,645
Oh, forget about it. She rocks!
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,587
Where do I know you from?
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,226
Dr. Drake Ramoray?
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,362
Days of Our Lives?
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:01,629
Voted most datable neurosurgeon
by Teen Beat?
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:03,891
No, that's not it.
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,436
So you're a soap actor.
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:10,904
Well, this must be exciting for you,
being in a real play.
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,908
Hey, I've done plays before.
I'm a serious actor.
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:16,441
That infomercial!
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,583
For the milk-carton-spout thing!
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:23,447
You're the guy who doesn't
know how to pour milk!
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:29,222
See, I actually can pour milk.
But I got you believing that I couldn't.
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,090
Now, see, that's acting.
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,663
Right. At the end,
you choked on a cookie.
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:35,926
Yeah, that was real.
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:41,538
- I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
- I know.
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,504
So, what are you gonna tell him?
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:47,737
Well, I told him I would think about it,
but I'm gonna tell him no.
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:53,246
I mean, I think I'd say no
to anybody right now.
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:59,221
Oh, but it was so strange.
I mean, I'm standing there...
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:03,759
...with this charming, cute guy
who's asking me to go out with him...
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:07,693
...which I'm allowed to do,
and I felt guilty.
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,027
Like I'd be cheating
on Ross or something.
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,797
Wow. So, okay, maybe that means...
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,942
...that you're not over Ross yet,
and you have issues with your father.
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:25,648
- I don't have any issues with my father.
- Okay, so it's probably the Ross thing.
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:29,888
I hate this woman! I hate her!
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,751
She told everyone in the company
about that infomercial...
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,928
...and now they all keep asking me
to open their drinks!
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:40,563
Okay, and whenever I can't do it,
they're all, like, laughing at me!
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:45,666
- Hello.
- Hey.
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:48,363
So Rachel called.
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:50,834
Wants to see me.
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,804
Going over in a minute.
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:58,541
- Wow. What do you think she wants?
- Maybe the crazy fog has lifted...
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,743
...and she realizes that life
without me...
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,179
...sucks.
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:08,386
It's possible. You are very lovable.
I'd miss you if I broke up with you.
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,192
Just trying to be supportive.
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:15,233
Be supportive like a guy.
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,032
If I broke up with you, I'd miss you.
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,071
- Hi.
- Hi.
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:29,409
You wanted to see me?
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,476
Yeah.
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,381
Here's a box of your stuff.
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:41,723
- What?
- You know, it's just, like, hats...
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:45,455
...and a shirt and CDs.
Just sort of stuff that you've left here.
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:49,123
What are you doing?
Are you trying to hurt me or something?
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:51,533
No.
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:54,329
Ross, it...
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:58,942
It just seems that, you know,
it's time we, you know, move on.
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:00,770
I mean, don't you think?
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,006
- Yes.
- Yeah.
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,741
- Yes, I do.
- Good.
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:08,147
Yeah, I really do.
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,022
Hey!
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,249
This was a gift.
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:17,190
Ross, you got that for free
from the museum gift shop.
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:18,988
It's still a gift.
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:22,062
I got it from the gift shop.
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:25,935
Okay! All right! Give me the mug!
I'll keep the mug!
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:28,504
No! You know what,
don't do me any favors.
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,175
In fact...
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,607
...where's the rest of my stuff?
Like my...
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,212
This book is mine!
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:44,619
And that T-shirt you sleep in?
I'd like that back too. Yes, I do.
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:50,953
You know how much I love that T-shirt.
You never even wear that T-shirt.
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:54,257
I'm just trying to help you move on.
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:57,258
Oh, you are a petty man.
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,629
You are a petty, petty...
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,304
- Petty...
...petty, petty...
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:02,938
...small...
...small...
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:09,676
You are so just
doing this out of spite.
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:14,376
No. No. No. I'm gonna wear
this all the time! I love this shirt!
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:17,251
You have not worn
that T-shirt since you were 15!
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:20,118
- It doesn't even fit you anymore!
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,126
Oh, okay. Okay!
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:39,139
Now, if you don't mind,
I'm gonna take the rest of my stuff...
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,870
...and relax...
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:44,474
...in my favorite shirt.
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:48,615
You have a pleasant evening.
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:00,162
So you're, like, a zillionaire.
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,299
And you're our age.
You're our age.
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:10,099
You know what? You should buy a state
and then just name it after yourself.
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,067
What, like, Pete Dakota?
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,441
Yeah, or Mississi-Pete.
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,343
Oh, I got it. Pete Chicago.
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,785
That's not a state, Joe.
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,719
Oh, and Mississi-Pete is?
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,092
I gotta go. So...
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,195
- I'll see you guys later.
- Okay.
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,899
You're our age.
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:38,232
So are we on for tomorrow?
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,335
Absolutely.
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:44,438
Now, get out of here, you!
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:53,514
Okay, I'm running out of places
I can touch him.
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,578
Is something wrong with me?
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:58,382
I mean, why am I only attracted
to guys with no future?
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:01,251
Either they're too old,
or they're too young.
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,588
Or they're a big misogynist
jerk poet like Julio.
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,697
Who, by the way, I'm still attracted to.
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:10,028
And then there's Pete,
who's crazy about me...
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:13,137
...and he's absolutely perfect,
and there's, like, zip going on!
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,705
I mean, does it sound like
something's wrong with me?
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,933
Yeah, kind of.
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:23,113
Happy? Is that what
I'm supposed to be, Vic?
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,644
Happy?
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:27,478
Well, why don't you tell me
what you're supposed to be?
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:29,584
Because I sure as hell
can't figure it out.
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,587
I talk to you, and nothing!
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:35,522
You look at me, and it's nothing!
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,828
Nothing.
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:43,594
Tasty.
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:49,469
I'm really starting to feel like
you guys have a history. It's nice.
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:52,644
- I have a question about this scene.
- Yes.
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:56,542
Well, I don't understand
why Adrienne's attracted to Victor.
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:59,274
Peel the onion.
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,578
First of all, he's good-looking.
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:06,087
I think my character needs
a bit more of a reason than that.
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,759
Hey, how about this one?
It says so in the script!
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:15,725
You know, I don't know why
my character likes you either.
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,927
I mean, it says in the script
here that you're a bitch.
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:22,371
- It doesn't say that in the script.
- It does in mine.
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:28,612
I can blow-dry it.
I can put gel on it. It doesn't matter.
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:30,611
I still wind up with this little...
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:35,116
...cowlick-y thing on the middle part
of my head. It's so annoying.
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:37,652
- Does it bug you?
- You bug me.
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:54,202
Is there any chance
you didn't see that?
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:01,242
Ross, you gotta stop, okay?
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,245
You can't just stare through
the peephole for three hours.
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,444
You're gonna get peep-eye.
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:12,624
I knew it. I knew it.
I always knew she liked him.
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:15,123
You know, she'd say no,
but here we are, right?
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,591
We just broke up, first thing she does!
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:21,460
- You didn't just break up.
- Hey, it's been, like, three weeks!
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:25,694
You slept with somebody three hours
after you thought you broke up.
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,201
I mean, bullets have left guns slower.
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,570
Here they come! Here they...
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:34,640
If she kisses him good night,
I'll kill myself. I swear.
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,872
I can't, I can't watch.
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,617
Come on.
Date over! Date over!
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:43,148
- Here we go. She's going in.
- Okay.
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:46,051
She's going in.
Wait! He's going in!
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:49,292
He's going in!
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:53,488
The door's closed! I can't see
anything with the door closed!
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:57,567
And the inventor of the door
rests happily in his grave.
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,432
Okay, I have to do something.
I mean, I have to stop it!
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,799
- Stop what?
- I don't know.
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,601
But I have a feeling that
my being there will do it.
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:10,039
Look, this guy is bad news, Chandler.
I can sense he's an operator.
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:11,716
Rachel wouldn't date an operator.
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,977
They only make 20 grand a year
and they have to work nights.
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,854
I'll go over and I will
borrow something!
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:23,693
- Juice! I need juice!
- No! You can't!
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,730
- They must be stopped!
- I am your friend...
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:28,866
...and I am not gonna let you do this!
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:31,764
You are surprisingly strong!
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:35,796
- I need juice! People need juice!
- Look, man...
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,475
- People need juice!
- Listen to me!
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,837
Juice. They need...
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:47,014
She's moving on, okay? If it's not
this guy, it's gonna be somebody else.
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:50,052
And unless you're thinking
about subletting my peephole...
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:53,487
...you are gonna have to get used
to the fact the relationship is over!
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,525
Okay, man? It's over.
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:03,162
- Yeah. Okay.
- Okay.
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:06,236
It's just I miss her so much.
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,971
I know.
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:13,775
I know.
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:19,611
Is it just me, or did "subletting my
peephole" sound kind of dirty?
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:24,489
Why do your coffee mugs
have numbers on the bottom?
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,124
Oh, that's so Monica can keep track.
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:31,557
That way if one of them's missing,
she can be like, "Where's number 27?"
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:44,108
- You know what?
- No, and I don't think I'm gonna want to.
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,641
- I can't do this.
- Yep. That's what I didn't want to know.
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:52,475
Oh, Mark, I'm just doing this
for the wrong reasons, you know?
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,153
I'm just doing it to get back at Ross.
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:58,619
I'm sorry. It's not very fair to you.
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:02,553
Fair, shmair. You know?
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,094
Look, you wanna get back
at Ross, I am here for you.
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,499
Really.
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:13,729
No. No. I say, I say we get back at him
right here on this couch. Right here!
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,904
Oh, God.
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:20,468
I'm sorry about this.
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,848
That's okay.
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:27,913
- You sure?
- Yeah.
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:32,522
I can just go home and get back
at him by myself.
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,158
- And should become the penicillin
of the 21 st century.
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:43,199
And so today, this hospital
is about to take major steps...
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:46,428
...toward leading that revolution.
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:49,835
Hey, can I ask you something?
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:54,134
Where are we?
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:58,446
Well, with all these doctors
and nurses...
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,618
...I'm gonna say midget rodeo.
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,077
Just tell me the truth.
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,223
Okay.
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:11,289
You know, I don't think
I told you this...
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,863
...but I just recently got out
of a really serious relationship.
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,465
Oh, right.
Wasn't that, like, a year ago?
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:21,496
So I did tell you.
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:23,875
Well, you know,
that's not really the thing.
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:27,203
The thing is, is that right now
I'm just in a place in my life...
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:29,142
...where I just need to focus on me.
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,808
- Do you know what I mean?
- Oh, yeah, I know.
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:38,420
- I so want to be attracted to you.
- But you're not. Okay. Good.
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,658
I'm sorry.
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:47,422
You know what? Don't be. It's...
Don't be, because it's not so bad.
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,089
It's not?
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:51,826
Yeah. I know I'm no Jon Bon Jovi.
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:57,037
Or someone you find attractive.
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,734
I just think, you know...
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:03,640
...that you might end up
feeling differently.
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,884
Look, I don't want this
to come out wrong...
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:14,182
...but you seem awfully confident for
a guy I just told I wasn't attracted to.
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:17,226
Yeah, stupidly charming, isn't it?
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:20,631
Listen, let's...
You wanna get something to eat?
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,233
'Cause this place is kind of depressing.
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:29,296
Now the man who made all this
possible, Mr. Peter Becker.
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:31,708
One second.
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:43,419
I don't think this town is big enough
for the both of us to relax in.
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:48,150
Draw!
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,325
I wasn't doing anything.
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:02,331
Uh-oh. What did she do now?
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,510
Just because she went to Yale Drama,
she thinks she's, like...
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:10,375
...the greatest actress
since, since sliced bread.
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,946
Sliced bread.
A wonderful Lady Macbeth.
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:18,316
Oh, God. I just... I hate her. I hate her
with her "Oh, I'm so talented"...
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:22,492
...and "Oh, I'm so pretty,"
and "Oh, I smell so good."
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,861
I think somebody has
a crush on somebody.
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:30,125
Hey, Chandler, can we please try and stay
focused on my problem here, you know?
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:33,728
I'm talking about you,
you big, big freak.
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:39,902
You're out of your mind!
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:42,740
Hey, you've done nothing
but talk about her for 48 hours.
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:45,313
If you were in school,
you'd be pulling her pigtails...
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,712
...and pushing her down now.
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,887
Oh, yeah?
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:53,387
Then how come I keep thinking about her
in all these sexual scenarios and stuff?
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:03,791
Happy? Is that what I'm
supposed to be, Vic? Happy?
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,934
Well, why don't you tell me
what you're supposed to be?
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,107
Because I sure as hell
can't figure it out.
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:11,868
I talk to you, and it's nothing.
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:15,345
You look at me, and nothing.
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,354
Nothing.
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:35,796
You guys make me fly!
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,034
High!
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:43,006
Okay, we're gonna
pick it up here, tomorrow.
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,677
- Well, that was...
- Better?
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,074
Yeah. Yeah, it was definitely...
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,411
...an improvement.
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,287
- Good night.
- Kate.
00:20:58,323 --> 00:20:59,722
You forgot your shoes.
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,821
I'm probably gonna need those, huh?
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,826
Hey, listen, do you...
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:13,964
...feel like getting
a cup of coffee?
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:16,963
- Kate.
- Yeah.
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:19,700
- You ready to go?
- Yeah.
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:24,076
Very nice. Very nice.
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,009
So...
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,421
- See you tomorrow, huh?
- Yeah. Sure.
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,715
- Right.
- Good night.
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,591
Hey.
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,498
Why isn't it "Spiderman"?
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,670
You know? Like Goldman, Silverman?
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,873
Because it's not his last name.
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:54,238
It isn't?
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:56,141
No. It's not, like...
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:58,042
...like, Phil Spiderman.
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:02,212
He's a spider...
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,512
...man.
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:08,182
You know, like,
Goldman is a last name.
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,961
But there's no Gold Man.
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,392
Okay.
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:15,225
There should be a Gold Man!
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,496
- Hey.
- Hey, Rach.
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:21,297
- How was work?
- Oh, it was great.
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,634
Although I did sit down
where there wasn't a chair.
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,744
By the way, Ross dropped by
a box of your stuff.
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:31,473
Oh. Well, I guess I had
that one coming.
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:35,484
I'm just gonna throw it out.
It's probably just shampoo and...
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:38,188
Something wrong?
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:50,032
No. Nothing.
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,203
So, what kind of powers
would Gold Man have?
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:03,611
Okay. Well, he would
turn things to gold.
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:05,942
What about things that are already gold?
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:08,016
His work is done.
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:12,785
Okay, I have a friend, Jimmy Tupperman,
what would his powers be?
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:15,425
Tupper Man.
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:19,197
He would keep criminals fresh
until the police came.
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,301
- Okay. Let's play my game now.
- Okay.
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:28,337
All right, you yellow-bellied,
lily-livered... Draw!
