00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:08,865
Welcome, everybody!
Welcome to Amazing Discoveries!
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:11,537
It's on again!
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:14,109
Guys, could we please
not watch this?
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:18,111
This ever happen to you?
You go to get a glass of milk...
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:21,616
...but these cartons are so
flinging, flanging hard to open!
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,686
Boy, you said it, Mike.
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:29,692
- There's gotta be a better way.
- There is, Kevin!
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:33,461
- Can we please turn this off?
- No way, Kevin!
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,295
What if I told you there's
a new product that guarantees...
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,403
...you'll never have to open up
milk cartons again?
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,901
Meet the Milkmaster 2000!
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:47,806
- Intrigued?
- You're flinging, flanging right I am!
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:53,976
This is the first time he's used this.
You'll see how easy this is to do.
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:57,913
- This works in any milk carton.
- Wow, it is easy!
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:00,524
Now I can have milk every day.
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:05,021
I can't watch this anymore.
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:07,859
You've suffered enough.
We'll change it.
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:13,164
- How many times has this happened?
- There's gotta be a better way!
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:23,813
The One With the
Metaphorical Tunnel
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:06,583
It's official.
There are no good movies.
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,591
So let's go to a bad one,
and make out.
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:18,460
Perhaps you'd like me to turn so you
can bunny-bump against my back?
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:24,167
- Hey, man. What's up?
- Maybe you can tell me.
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,005
My agent wants to know why I didn't
show up at my audition today...
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:31,579
...my first good one in weeks. How
could you not give me the message?
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:34,679
I'll tell you, I do enjoy guilt...
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:36,949
...but it wasn't me.
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,818
Yes, it was.
It was him!
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,384
Okay, it was me!
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:47,956
- How was it you?
- Well, it was all so crazy, you know?
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:51,067
Chandler was in the closet,
counting to 10...
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:54,499
...and I hadn't found a place
to hide yet.
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:59,177
I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all
down on my hand. See? All of it.
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,476
Yep, that's my audition.
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:04,547
See? Now, this is why I keep
notepads everywhere.
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:08,550
Yep. And that's why we don't
invite you to play.
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:12,315
What is the great tragedy here?
Get yourself another appointment.
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:16,518
Estelle tried. The casting director
told her I missed my chance.
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:17,957
Well, that is unfair!
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:20,858
I'll call her.
I'll tell her it was my fault.
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,001
You can't. The casting director
doesn't talk to friends.
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:27,468
- She only talks to agents.
- What a sad little life she must lead.
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,009
- What are you doing?
- No, I know, I know.
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,680
Hi, this is Caitlin
from Phoebe Buffay's office.
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:42,380
Is Anne there for Phoebe?
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:44,880
She'll know what it's about.
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:46,591
Hang up. Hang up right...
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:52,189
Annie? Hi. Listen, we've got
a problem with Joey Tribbiani.
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:55,924
Apparently, he missed his audition.
Who did you speak to in my office?
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,295
Estelle? I don't know
what to do with her.
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:02,837
So your husband leaves and burns down
the apartment. The world doesn't stop.
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,601
Is anybody else scared?
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:11,081
If Joey loses this audition, then
that is it for Estelle. I don't care!
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:15,884
Annie, you are a doll. What time can
you see him? I need a pen. Pen!
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:26,456
Get the woman a pad!
Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:29,662
Oh, now you want a pad.
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,670
That's funny. Ugly Naked Guy's naked,
but his dog's wearing a sweater.
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:46,477
Hey!
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,586
Where's my boy?
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,847
Here's my boy!
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:55,050
And here's his Barbie!
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,261
What's my boy doing with a Barbie?
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,830
He picked it out at the store.
He loves it.
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:08,563
He carries it everywhere,
like a security blanket.
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:11,468
But with ski boots and a kicky beret.
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,642
Yeah, it's cute.
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:17,645
Why does he have it again?
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:21,148
So he's got a doll. So what?
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:25,146
Unless you're afraid
he's gonna grow up to be...
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,187
...in show business.
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,661
This wouldn't have
to do with the fact...
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,887
...that he's being raised
by two women?
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:38,496
You know what? It's fine. If you're
okay with the Barbie thing, so am I.
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:41,969
Give Daddy the Barbie.
Give me the Barbie.
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,541
Don't you wanna play
with a monster truck?
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,774
No? Okay.
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:52,077
How about a Dino-Soldier?
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:57,912
You are so pathetic.
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:01,684
Why can't your son
just play with his doll?
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,392
I gotta go to work.
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,934
Has anybody seen my left boob?
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,241
I loved that movie.
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,740
Here it is.
What are you doing?
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,613
I'm sorry. It just felt nice.
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:30,615
Answer the phone.
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:35,151
I only got one arm. You should
do stuff for me. Get me a sweater.
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:37,652
Just do it! It's Janice.
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:40,899
And if I get it, I'll have
to see her tonight.
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:45,126
That's great.
I'll have to see her tonight.
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,601
Why don't you want to see Janice?
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,774
Last night at dinner,
when the meals came...
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:54,945
...she put half her chicken piccata
on my plate and took all my tomatoes.
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,650
And that's bad...
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:01,453
...because you hate chicken piccata?
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:07,783
You didn't want to share your tomatoes.
Tomatoes are very important to you.
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,756
Suddenly, we were this "couple."
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:12,487
And this alarm started going off
in my head.
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:15,164
"Run for your life!
Get out of the building!"
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:21,332
Men are unbelievable. Janice thought
she was giving you chicken.
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,772
She didn't think she was giving you
scary chicken.
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,501
What is it with you people?
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:29,610
The minute you feel something,
you have to run away?
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,041
I know. That...
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:37,850
That's why I don't want to go tonight.
I'm afraid I'll say something stupid.
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:41,285
You mean that "guy thing" where
you act mean and distant...
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,188
...until we break up with you?
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:44,589
You know about that?
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,193
What do I do?
I wanna get past this.
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,731
I don't want to be afraid
of commitment.
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:54,336
I want to go through the tunnel
to the other side!
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,473
Where there's no fear of commitment.
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,946
Do we have any...
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,580
Do we have any thoughts here?
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:09,683
I've never been through
the tunnel myself because...
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,254
...you're not allowed through
with more than one girl in the car.
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:19,897
But it seems to me it's pretty much
like anything else. Face your fear.
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:23,100
Fear of heights?
Go to the top of the building.
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:25,360
You're afraid of bugs.
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,104
Get a bug.
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:31,773
You have a fear of commitment.
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:36,344
So I say you go in there and you be
the most committed guy there ever was!
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:38,777
Amazingly, that makes sense.
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:42,748
- Do you think?
- Oh, yeah! Go for it, man!
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,080
Jump off the high dive!
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:48,053
Stare down the barrel of the gun!
Pee into the wind!
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:52,195
If I'm staring down
the barrel of a gun...
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:55,628
...I'm gonna be pretty much
peeing every which way.
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:02,800
Listen to this and tell me
what you think.
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,109
That's interesting.
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:12,307
- Honey?
- Oh, because it's a beeper.
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:17,287
It's your audition from this morning!
Can I use the phone?
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:22,392
Sure, that's what it's there for.
Emergencies and pretend agents.
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:25,227
Come on, baby! Come on!
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,729
Hi. I have Phoebe Buffay
returning a page.
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:33,496
Okay, she's in her car.
I'll have to patch you through.
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,366
Very nice touch.
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:37,974
Okay, go ahead.
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:41,436
Talk, talk, talk!
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,471
Hi, Annie?
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,116
Fantastic. You got it!
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:52,617
Will he work for scale, you ask me?
Well, I don't know about that.
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:55,019
Except that I do and he will.
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,862
Great. Oh, you are such a sweetheart.
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:03,501
I would love to have lunch with you!
How about we have lunch next...
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,704
Went through a tunnel.
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,064
Unbelievable.
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,069
Oh, thank you so much!
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:13,773
It was really fun. I mean, I've never
talked on a car phone before.
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:17,445
You are so amazing!
Could you do me this huge favor?
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,083
There's another audition I want,
and Estelle couldn't get me in.
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,788
I don't know.
It was fun one time, but...
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,491
Please? It would just be
this one more.
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:29,420
- Well, actually it's two.
- Two?
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:35,601
Well, really it's three. Please?
You're so good at it. I love you.
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:39,569
- Okay. But just these three, right?
- No, it's four.
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,170
So how come you wanted
to eat in tonight?
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,144
Because I wanted...
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,316
...to give you this.
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:55,845
Are you a puppy!
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,891
Contact paper!
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:05,362
What do you say when someone
you're sleeping with...
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,189
...gives you contact paper?
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:12,393
Wait, there's more.
See, the contact paper is to go...
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:15,265
...in your brand new drawer!
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,742
See, the drawer actually
goes in my dresser.
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:24,943
- You didn't have to do this.
- Yes, I did.
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,745
Yes, I did.
Because you're my girlfriend...
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,887
...and that's what girlfriends
should get.
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,349
Well, I gotta buy a vowel...
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:40,696
...because, oh, my God!
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,264
Who would've thought that someday...
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:46,404
...Chandler Bing would buy me
a drawer?
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,834
Well, not me.
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,874
But that's what's happened.
And there's more.
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:57,711
We should take a trip.
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,351
We should?
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:02,348
We're a couple,
and that's what couples do.
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:04,889
And I wanna meet your parents.
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:08,116
We should take a trip
with your parents!
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:17,535
I don't think we need to because
you're tripping me out right now!
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,035
- Are you okay?
- No, I am.
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,471
I actually am! This is amazing.
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:26,074
My entire life, I have feared
this place.
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:29,543
And now that I'm here, it's like,
what was the big deal?
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:33,082
I could probably say, "Let's move in
together," and I'd be okay.
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,885
You probably want us
to move in together?
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,115
- It doesn't scare me!
- Yeah, well it scares me!
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:44,157
I'm not even divorced yet! You just
invited me over here for pasta...
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:47,489
...and now you're talking
about moving in together.
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,494
And I wasn't even that hungry.
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:53,999
You know what? It's getting really
late, and I should just...
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,970
Don't go! I've scared you!
I've said too much!
00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:00,838
I'm hopeless and awkward
and desperate for love!
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,284
Hey, Janice, it's me.
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:15,117
I wanted to apologize in advance for
having chased you down the street.
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:26,167
Here you go, honey. This will help.
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,974
So I catch up to her
and she says...
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:32,677
...this relationship's going too fast
and we have to slow down.
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,675
That is never good.
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,040
Then I got all...
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,449
...needy and clingy.
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:44,385
- You didn't beg, did you?
- I said please.
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:48,582
Was it please with one E
in the middle or lots of E's?
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,789
Oh, dear Lord, I begged.
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,097
Wait a minute. Maybe it's
not so bad. How did you leave it?
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,699
She said she'd call me.
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,302
Oh, God.
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,305
Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:07,746
This ice cream tastes like crap,
by the way.
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:11,439
Yeah, well, it's that
low-cal-nondairy-soymilk junk.
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:14,151
We save the real stuff
for the truly terminal cases.
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:18,590
When you're getting screwed over all
the time, you gotta switch to low fat.
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:20,621
Yeah, you do.
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,461
You don't think I'm terminal?
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:27,962
Not at all. You're not terminal.
We just need some damage control.
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,658
- Okay. Should I call her?
- No!
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:36,573
Very critical time. If you feel
yourself reaching for that phone...
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:39,242
...go shopping, get your butt
in a bubble bath.
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:43,039
If you want her back,
you have got to start acting aloof.
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:45,773
Aloof?
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,853
She needs to know you're not needy.
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:54,788
So what you have to do is accidentally
run into her on purpose...
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,928
...and then act aloof.
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,793
- And then I'll be okay?
- Yeah. I think so.
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:04,302
So I'm not gonna lose her?
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:07,597
Oh, honey, you're not a total loser.
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:13,606
I said, "So I'm not gonna lose her?"
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:22,281
Guess who's here!
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:25,489
It's the toughest guy in Toyland, Ben!
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:29,650
Real American hero
I'm G.I. Joe!
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:32,194
Drop the Barbie. Drop the Barbie.
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,992
G.I. Joe?
You really think he'll fall for that?
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:40,627
G.I. Joe?
Cool! Can I play?
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:45,969
Look, Ben! It's a toy that protects
U.S. Oil interests overseas!
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:48,476
Go, Joe!
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:50,812
Hello?
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,211
- There you are!
- No, it's not. Sorry.
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,080
But, Phoebe, wait, wait.
Phoebe!
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:59,587
Oh, Joey! Oh, okay!
See, I didn't recognize you...
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,189
...in those pants.
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,728
That TV movie I went in for, did you
hear anything? I think I got a shot.
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,829
Yes, they called!
You didn't get it!
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:14,333
Okay? I mean, you didn't get it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:17,005
That's okay. These things happen.
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,107
But they shouldn't happen.
You know what?
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,973
You're in a terrible,
terrible business.
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:27,277
I don't want to be the person
who makes you look like that.
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,453
I'm okay. See?
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,621
Now you're sad and creepy.
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:35,717
I'm sorry. I quit.
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:40,363
No, no, you can't quit!
You're the best agent I ever had.
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:44,126
Rejection is part of being an actor.
You can't take it personal.
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:48,830
They said they'd never met an Italian
actor with a worse Italian accent.
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,033
They actually said that?
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:55,212
Oh, God, there's that face again.
See? I can't do this job!
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:58,905
This is why you have to do
this job! Agents always lie.
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:02,086
Estelle just says stuff like,
"They went another way."
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,117
But this? I can use this.
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,257
I can work on a new accent.
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:11,426
Yeah, okay. If it
helps you, okay. Yeah.
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:15,326
You'll never get me, Joe!
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,912
No, thank you.
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:36,153
- Chandler!
- Hello, Janice.
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,187
What are you doing here?
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,520
Just a bit of shopping.
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,125
How have you been?
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,722
Are you being British?
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,399
Not anymore.
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,665
Why are you shopping here?
You don't live in this neighborhood.
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,407
Were you here waiting for me?
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,305
I'm just...
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:06,476
...picking up some things for a party.
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:09,512
Barley?
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,515
What kind of party serves barley?
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,818
I'm sorry if my friends aren't
as sophisticated as yours.
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,820
- Where is this party?
- Here in Chelsea.
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,732
Whose party is it?
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,059
A woman's.
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,326
What woman?
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,931
Chelsea.
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:32,204
Either you're seeing somebody
behind my back...
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,106
...which would make you
the world's biggest jerk...
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:37,577
...or you're pretending
to see somebody...
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:41,343
...which makes you so pathetic
I could cry right here!
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:45,045
So which of these two guys
do you want to be?
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,854
Can I be that guy?
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:55,365
Okay, we got some more good
rejections. Lots of stuff to work on.
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:56,960
Okay. Shoot.
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:00,796
- Okay. Oh, the zoo commercial.
- I didn't get it?
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,533
No. They said that you
"weren't believable as a human being."
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,469
So you can work on that.
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:10,482
Great.
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:11,916
What else?
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:16,085
The off-Broadway-play people said
that you were "pretty but dumb."
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:19,280
Oh, no wait. I'm sorry.
That's "pretty dumb."
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,752
Look, it's okay, no, no, no.
Really.
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,051
Look...
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,588
...I really appreciate this...
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,762
...but I'm gonna have to
go back to Estelle.
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,535
Don't get me wrong.
You're a better agent than she is...
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:36,602
...but at least with her, I don't want
to blow my pretty dumb brains out.
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,811
Yeah, no, I understand.
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:41,478
You do? Thanks. Okay.
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:42,814
Sorry.
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:47,744
Wait a minute.
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,248
Wait a minute.
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,820
Did you make all that stuff up
to get out of being my agent?
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,456
Oh, he caught me.
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,590
I am so busted!
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:01,992
That's what I suspected!
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:07,462
And then I just, you know...
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:11,638
...threw the bag of barley at her
and ran out of the store.
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:16,008
My God, Chandler, we said be "aloof,"
not "a doof."
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,480
I've actually ruined this, haven't I?
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:24,578
Is it time for the good ice cream now?
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,285
- It's time.
- Yeah, it is.
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:33,124
Everything's gonna be okay.
You know why?
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:37,632
Because you got 65 grams of fat
coming your way.
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:43,133
Hello? Hi, Janice.
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,939
Can you hold on for a second?
Okay.
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,170
Okay. What do I do?
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,314
I don't know.
This is unprecedented.
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,144
If we did what you did,
a man would never call.
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:58,389
I got it! Pretend you just woke up.
That'll throw her off!
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,922
- Be sleepy!
- Yes! And grumpy!
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,753
What are you...?
Stop naming dwarfs!
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,761
Hello, Janice? Hi.
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:11,595
I'm so glad that you called.
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:17,207
I know I've been acting
really weird lately...
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:21,569
...and it's just because
I'm crazy about you...
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:28,513
...and I just got stupid and scared...
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:30,688
...and stupid a couple more times.
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:32,790
And I'm sorry.
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:35,360
Really?
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:38,520
Really?
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:41,892
He's so lucky.
If Janice were a guy...
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,297
...she'd be sleeping
with somebody else by now.
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,636
I love you too.
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,530
It's so unfair!
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,584
G.I. Joe? G.I. Joe?!
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:03,846
I don't know what to tell you guys.
That's the doll he chose.
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,647
What'd you do, dip it in sugar?
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:09,053
Look, G.I. Joe's in, Barbie's out.
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:13,253
And if you guys can't deal with it,
that's just your too bad.
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,634
What are you being such a weenie for?
So he has a Barbie. Big deal.
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:21,099
You used to dress up like a woman.
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,876
What?
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,412
The way you used to dress up
in Mom's clothes?
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,345
What are you talking about?
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:36,815
The big hat, the pearls,
the little pink handbag?
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,456
Okay. You are totally
making this up.
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,655
How can you not remember?
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,860
You made us call you "Bea"?
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:52,494
Oh, God.
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:56,307
I've literally never been this happy.
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:58,701
Wasn't there a little song?
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:01,310
Oh, please, God,
let there be a song.
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,537
There was no song.
There was no song.
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:05,249
- I am Bea
- Okay.
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,277
- I drink tea...
- That's enough.
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:08,951
Won't you...?
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:11,385
Won't you...?
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:13,890
Won't you...?
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,954
Won't you dance around with me?
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:26,159
I am Bea
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:29,033
I drink tea
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:34,679
Won't you dance around with...?
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,121
Ross!
