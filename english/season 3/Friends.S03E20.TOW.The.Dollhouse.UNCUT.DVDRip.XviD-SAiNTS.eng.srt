00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:04,463
You're telling me
this actress person...
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:08,835
...is the only woman you ever wanted
who didn't want you back?
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:11,271
Oh, my God.
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:14,242
Is this what it's like to be you?
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:18,050
- You're crazy about her, huh?
- You have no idea.
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:22,153
When we're on-stage,
I get to kiss her and touch her.
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:24,082
She goes home with the director...
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,850
...and it's like somebody's
ripping out my heart.
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,621
It's so great to see you
feeling like this.
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,836
Dad called this morning.
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:40,706
Aunt Sylvia passed away.
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:44,208
Yes! Yes!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:49,711
We were all
pretty shaken up about it.
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:51,246
Am I missing something?
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:54,249
I always thought death was
supposed to be sad, in a way.
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:57,350
Well, Aunt Sylvia was...
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,217
...not a nice person.
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:03,726
She was a cruel, cranky old bitch.
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:08,296
And I'm sorry she died.
Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:11,729
- You get the dollhouse.
- I get the dollhouse!
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:17,233
A house for dolls!
That is so cool.
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:20,112
When I was a kid, I had a barrel.
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:23,838
You had a barrel for a dollhouse?
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,484
No, just a barrel.
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,146
You know what? You can play
with my dollhouse.
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:31,822
- Really?
- Any time you want.
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:35,085
When I was younger, all I wanted
was to play with this dollhouse.
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:38,423
But no! It was to be looked at,
never played with.
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:42,226
My grandmother used to say
that exact same thing to me.
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,338
More of a bathtub-type situation.
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,167
She did give you one chance.
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:52,902
She told Monica she could play with
the dollhouse if she lost 20 pounds.
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:57,444
Yeah, well, look who's
losing weight now, Aunt Sylvia.
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:04,822
The One With the Doll House
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:52,367
Thanks for lunch.
You didn't have to walk me here.
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,904
That's okay. No problem.
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,440
You do realize we don't keep the
women's lingerie here in the office.
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,776
Yes, I realize that.
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:09,253
- Summer catalog.
- That's the stuff.
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:12,857
Rachel, I need the Versace invoice.
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,525
You don't work for me.
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:18,720
Joanna, this is my friend
Chandler Bing. Joanna.
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,627
Bing? That's a great name.
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:24,868
Thanks. It's Gaelic for,
"Thy turkey's done."
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:30,832
- I'm gonna go. Nice meeting you.
- You too.
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:35,674
So, what's wrong with him?
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:39,978
Nothing. He's just goofy like that.
I actually hardly notice it anymore.
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:45,556
No, no. I mean, is he married
or involved with anyone?
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:49,854
He's not married
or involved with anyone.
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:52,892
Well, Rachel...
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,033
Actually, you know what?
Forget it.
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,670
- I'll ask him for you, if you want.
- Would you?
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:02,705
Or is it too sad and desperate,
something that Sophie would do?
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,003
- I am here.
- I know that.
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,072
Look at it!
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:13,784
Wallpaper's a little faded.
That's okay.
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,420
Carpet's a little loose.
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,089
Hardwood floors?!
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:26,964
- It's so beautiful!
- I know!
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,661
So I'm here, ready to play!
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,034
I brought a bunch of stuff
for the house, so check it out.
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,037
What's this?
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:42,680
That's a dog.
Every house should have a dog.
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:46,175
Not one that can pee on the roof.
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:52,857
Maybe it's so big because the house
was built on radioactive waste.
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:58,329
And is this in case
the house sneezes?
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,227
No, that's the ghost for the attic.
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:08,503
- I don't want a ghost.
- Well, nobody wants a ghost.
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,840
But you've got one...
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:15,879
...because the house is sitting on
an ancient Indian burial ground.
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:20,347
Wait a minute. The house
was built on radioactive waste...
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:23,750
...and an ancient
Indian burial ground?
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:26,686
That would never happen.
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:30,894
Obviously you don't know much
about the U.S. Government.
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,693
- I need to talk to you.
- Sure. What's up?
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:40,331
Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,301
I know.
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,037
Well, if something comes up...
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:55,177
I'm glad you guys are past
that little awkward phase.
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:59,354
My boss. Joanna. When you left...
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,084
...she started asking questions
about you...
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,092
Liked what she saw?
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,396
Dug my action, did she?
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:11,798
Checking out the Chan Chan Man!
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:16,999
That was...
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,041
...surreal.
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:21,543
What do you think?
Are you interested at all?
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:26,148
Yeah. She seemed cool.
Attractive. I'll do it.
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:29,913
Thank you. This is so great.
She's gonna love me.
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,051
Dinosaur attack!
Quick, everybody into the house!
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:39,222
All right, Phoebe, you know what?
That's it. That's it. All right?
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:42,799
No dinosaurs, no ghosts,
no giant dogs, okay?
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:46,870
They're not the right size, they're
not Victorian and they don't go.
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,974
Fine.
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:56,210
Come, dinosaur. We're not welcome
in the house of no imagination.
00:06:56,416 --> 00:07:00,910
While we're hovering around the subject,
I just have to say that dinosaurs...
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,146
...they don't go, "ruff!"
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:08,119
The little ones do.
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:17,528
- Hey, Kate.
- Morning.
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:20,171
I went to that restaurant
you were talking about...
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:21,533
Hey, lovely.
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:24,107
Come, talk to me for a minute.
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:28,840
And I ate the food. It was good.
I had the fish. Yeah, really good.
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,581
I'm Lauren. Kate's understudy.
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,186
- Joey Tribbiani.
- I know.
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,220
I'm a big fan of yours.
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:40,255
What?
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:44,994
I used to schedule my classes
so I could watch Dr. Drake Ramoray...
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,825
...on Days of our Lives.
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,866
- Get out of here. Really?
- Absolutely.
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:53,236
But then they went and dropped you
down that elevator shaft.
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,704
They gave me the shaft, all right.
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:59,036
You're so funny.
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,577
What are you doing after rehearsal?
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:05,512
- Want to get a drink or something?
- Well...
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,952
Yeah. Sure.
A drink sounds great.
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,650
- Cool. I'll see you then.
- All right.
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:23,167
All right. It's time to act,
my talking props.
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,903
If you wanna make the
boys' bathroom realistic...
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,807
...you're gonna have to put some teeny,
tiny porno magazines behind the toilet.
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,848
Look everybody!
Look at my new dollhouse!
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,417
Look, look!
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:52,861
Hey, what's this?
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:56,125
It's a slide instead of stairs.
Look.
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:01,099
Very interesting, Phoebe.
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:02,975
What's this?
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:06,667
The licorice room.
You can eat all the furniture.
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:12,614
When guests come over, they can
stay on the Tootsie Roll-away bed.
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:16,086
This is the coolest house ever!
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,225
Does anyone want to join me
in the Aroma Room?
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:22,451
- All right.
- I would.
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,353
Hey, guys? Guys!
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,930
Did you see my new china cabinet?
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,233
Watch. Watch.
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,064
And. And.
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:41,875
Hey, my father's house does that.
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:46,009
Okay. How did it go?
Tell me everything!
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:47,549
The movie was great...
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:52,281
...dinner was great, and there's nothing
like a cool, crisp New York evening.
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:57,952
Of course, I didn't enjoy any of that
because Joanna's such a big, dull dud!
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,730
Chandler is fantastic!
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,935
- What?
- We click! You know how people click?
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:08,300
He came by to pick me up, I opened
the door and it was just like, "click!"
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,064
Did he tell you?
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,006
He's got such a good heart.
Doesn't he have a good heart?
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:17,080
And he's so sweet. He said he'd
call, so put him straight through.
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,514
- Isn't this great?
- Don't spoil it.
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:26,420
Come on, baby, don't go. Please?
What do you say?
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:32,996
It's you.
Just one sec.
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,601
I'm going to take this call.
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:40,203
When I continue, I hope
that there will appear on-stage...
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:44,843
...this magical thing
that in the theater we call...
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:48,036
...committing to the moment!
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,778
The guy's like a cartoon.
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,586
- What do you see in him, anyway?
- He happens to be brilliant.
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,424
Which is more than I can say
for that sweater you're dating.
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,229
I'm not interested in her sweater.
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:10,061
It's what's underneath her sweater
that counts.
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:15,840
And besides, since when do you care
who I'm going out with?
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,977
I don't care.
Why, do you want me to care?
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:22,672
Do you want me
to want you to care?
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,577
Do you?
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:25,944
What?
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:31,146
Okay. I'm afraid to say this,
but let's pick it up where we left off.
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:42,027
Come on, baby, don't go. Please?
What do you say?
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:44,828
I've got no reason to stay.
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:52,002
Stop! Stop it!
You must stop!
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,914
You are bad actors!
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,550
This is a terrible play!
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:02,084
I'll see you in the morning.
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:07,922
I can't believe we go on
in a week.
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:10,493
Hey, it's gonna be all right.
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:15,800
So since we're getting off early,
do you want to go and paint mugs?
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:18,894
What?
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:22,666
At the place I told you about
last night?
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,942
Yeah, with the mug-painting.
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:28,670
I was so listening to that.
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:33,282
But you know what?
I need to work on my stuff tonight.
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:36,148
Okay.
I'll see you tomorrow.
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:42,951
Good night.
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,662
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I guess.
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,039
What are we gonna do
about the scene?
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:57,607
I don't know.
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,478
Maybe if it had more heat.
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:06,378
Well, how do you mean?
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:10,783
Adrianne's looking
for a reason to stay, right?
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,754
Victor can't just kiss her.
He's gotta...
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,291
He's gotta really give her a reason.
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:19,290
Maybe he could slip her the tongue.
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:26,932
Or maybe...
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:31,132
Maybe he could grab her,
and lift her up.
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:35,370
Then Adrianne could wrap her legs
around his waist.
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,411
She could do that.
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:41,313
And claw at his back.
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,583
Right. Then she could rip off his shirt
and kiss his chest and his stomach.
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:50,785
Then he could use his teeth
to undo her dress...
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,691
...and bite her!
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:54,832
And then right when the scene ends...
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:59,937
...he could take her
with this raw, animal...
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,234
Something like that?
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:09,744
Yeah. That's pretty much
what I had in mind.
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:33,328
It's a little early to be drinking.
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:38,231
Things finally happened with Kate.
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,241
- You're kidding?
- That's great.
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,004
It was so amazing.
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,512
After the lovemaking...
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,742
Oh, my!
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:50,284
...I just watched her sleep for hours.
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:52,389
Just breathing in...
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:53,717
...and breathing out.
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:59,029
And then I knew she was dreaming
because her eyes kept going like this:
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:07,699
I'm telling you,
Joanna's got it all wrong.
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:11,502
All I said was, "This was fun.
Let's do it again some time.
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,735
I'll give you a call."
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:17,677
I wonder why she thinks you're going
to call her?
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:20,342
That's what you say
at the end of a date.
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:23,350
You can't just say,
"Nice to meet you. Good night"?
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:26,285
To her face?
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,526
I'm so happy.
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:32,689
It's the end of the date.
I'm standing there...
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:36,766
...all she's waiting for is for me to say
I'll call her, and it just comes out.
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:40,336
I can't help it.
It's a compulsion.
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:45,408
When a guy says he'll call,
it doesn't mean he's going to call.
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,669
This never happened to you?
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,871
Well, they always called.
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:51,683
Bite me.
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:01,023
- Did he call?
- No, sorry.
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:04,525
Why? He said he'd call.
Why hasn't he called?
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,826
Maybe he's intimidated by really
smart, strong, successful women.
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:12,162
Sophie, will you please
climb out of my butt.
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,274
Why hasn't he called, Rachel?
Why?
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:21,808
Well, maybe he feels awkward
because you are my boss.
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:24,448
Awkward?
Why should he feel awkward?
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,211
The person that should feel awkward
is you. Did you tell him not to call me?
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,082
If you're uncomfortable with him
dating someone you work for...
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,724
...there are always ways to fix that.
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,630
Call her. Call her now!
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,297
Multiple so many paper cuts.
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,169
"Why hasn't he called, Rachel?
Why, why? I don't understand!
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:48,465
He said he'd call. Why?"
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,734
I'm telling you, she's flipped out!
She's gone crazy!
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:55,446
Well, give me the phone then.
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:58,411
This isn't funny. She thinks
it's my fault you haven't called.
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:00,050
- You have to call her.
- Look...
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:02,618
...you can't call somebody
after this long to say:
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:05,790
"In case you didn't notice,
I don't like you."
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:08,824
- Then you'll have to take her out again.
- No!
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,053
She's really dull,
and she gets this...
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:15,461
...gross mascara-goop thing
in the corner of her eye!
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:19,866
I don't care! You're gonna have
to take her out again and end it.
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:22,666
And end it in a way
that she knows it's actually ended.
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,743
I don't care how hard it is.
Don't tell her you'll call her again!
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:30,142
All right, fine! But it's just
a lunch date. No more than an hour.
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:33,841
From now on, I get my own dates.
I don't want you setting me up again!
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,987
That's fine!
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:39,121
- That's just a lot of big talk.
- I know.
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,963
I'm in the shower.
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:00,607
Fire! There's a fire! Fire!
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:38,579
I talked to Lauren.
I told her how things were with us.
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,514
Did you talk to Marshall?
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,880
About what?
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,555
About what happened with us.
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:52,630
No, and there's really no reason
why he should find out.
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,994
So let's not make a big deal
out of it, okay?
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:59,470
What are you talking about?
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:01,935
It was a big deal.
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:06,372
You can't tell me last night
didn't mean something to you.
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:10,014
I was there.
You're not that good an actress.
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,452
I was just caught up in the moment.
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:17,451
That's all it was.
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,025
Joey, I'm sorry you feel bad, but...
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:24,923
...haven't you slept with a woman where
it meant more to her than it did to you?
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,097
No.
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,701
- Hi, Kate.
- Hi, Lauren.
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,371
- Hi, Lauren.
- Hi, pig!
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:43,146
- Sorry I scared you in there.
- It's okay.
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,411
By the way...
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:48,745
...I was just checking
the shower massager.
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:55,059
I tried to reach you at work.
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,660
There's been a fire.
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,957
What?
Oh, my God!
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:03,962
What happened?
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:07,036
We believe it originated here...
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,200
...in the Aroma Room.
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,208
Did everyone get out okay?
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:16,540
The giraffe's okay,
and so is the pirate.
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,440
- What is this?
- No, don't look!
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,914
You don't want to see
what's under there!
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:26,217
The foster puppets!
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:34,829
It's not a big deal. It's right
here, and it's all the time.
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:39,936
Well, thanks again for lunch.
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:46,676
- Yes. This was pleasant.
- It was, wasn't it?
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:50,846
- The food there was great.
- Wasn't it?
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,877
So take care.
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,414
You too.
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,892
This was great. I'll give you a call.
We should do it again!
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,288
Great. I'm looking forward to it.
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:06,794
- Rachel, any messages?
- Sophie's desk.
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:12,696
- Are you gonna call her?
- No.
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:17,630
I'm sorry, okay? I'm weak
and pathetic and sorry.
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:20,744
You are gonna tell her.
You'll tell her now.
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,675
I'm not gonna call you.
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,084
What?
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:35,115
I'm sorry that I said I was going to
when I'm not.
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:40,264
It's just that I was trying to be nice,
and you don't deserve that.
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:46,295
- I see. I think.
- Look, this has nothing to do with you.
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:48,803
And this isn't Rachel's fault.
It's me.
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:52,170
I have serious problems
when it comes to women.
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:57,076
I have issues with commitment,
intimacy...
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:00,951
...mascara goop.
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:06,784
I'm really sorry. It's just that
this isn't going to work out.
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:13,655
Well, this isn't how
I was hoping this would end...
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:17,164
...but I guess I have to appreciate
your honesty.
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,732
Yeah. Okay.
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:22,464
So...
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:28,236
This is great. I'll give you a call.
We should do it again!
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:36,379
So anyway, Beth,
what I'm saying is...
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:40,786
...I should have considered your
feelings before I went home with you.
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:46,294
I've recently learned what it's like
to be on your side of it...
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,591
...and I'm sorry.
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:52,261
So do you think
you can forgive me?
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:55,131
Great. Thanks.
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,331
Okay. Bye.
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,047
Hello, Jennifer?
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:09,948
Hi, Mrs. Laurio.
Is Jennifer there?
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,282
She's not home, huh?
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,682
Well, actually,
I need to talk to you too.
