00:00:04,204 --> 00:00:05,535
Oh, come on!
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:08,033
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too.
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:10,732
You know, instead of watching
football, you could help.
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:12,239
We know.
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,543
Hey, Rachel, you wanna put the
marshmallows in concentric circles.
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,988
No, Mon, you want to put
them in concentric circles.
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,918
I want to do this.
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,761
Every year.
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:41,872
The One With the Football
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:25,179
To the ten, to the five.
Touchdown, Giants!
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:30,880
You know, for once I am gonna sit down
and try to watch one of these things.
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:33,181
Halftime.
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:36,890
Who wants to throw
the ball around?
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,089
- Get a little three-on-three going?
- That would be so much fun.
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,861
- Can I play too?
- I've never played football, like, ever.
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,903
Great! You can cover Chandler.
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:49,870
No, no. I don't really want to play.
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:53,503
You never want to do anything
since you and Janice broke up.
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:57,945
That's not true. I wanted to wear my
bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day.
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:01,450
I wanted to start drinking in the morning.
Don't say I don't have goals!
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:04,648
Chandler, you have to start
getting over her, all right?
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:08,487
If you play, you get some fresh air.
Maybe it'll take your mind off Janice.
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:12,392
If you don't play, everyone will be mad
at you because the teams won't be even.
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,363
- Come on.
- All right, I'll play.
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:18,401
But I don't like you.
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:22,065
- Let's do it! Ross?
- What?
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,140
Wanna play football?
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:30,078
Monica and I aren't supposed
to play football.
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,676
Says who? Your mom?
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:34,720
- Yeah.
- Yes.
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,557
"What do you mean?"
She asks her boyfriend...
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:41,090
...really scared to hear the answer.
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:45,328
Every Thanksgiving, we used
to have a touch football game...
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,227
...called the Geller Bowl.
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,731
No, no, no. You say that proudly!
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:54,171
Anyway, Ross and I
were always captains.
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:57,935
It got kind of competitive,
and one year, Geller Bowl VI...
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:01,511
...I accidentally broke Ross' nose.
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:04,874
It was so not an accident.
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:07,483
She saw I was about to tag her,
so she threw...
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,622
...her big fat
grandma-arm elbow in my face...
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,757
...and just kept running.
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,927
To score the winning touchdown,
by the way.
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,627
You did not win the game.
The touchdown didn't count...
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:24,860
...because of the spectacularly
illegal, and savage, nose-breaking.
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:27,266
I won the game.
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:31,341
Oh, yeah? Then how come
you didn't get the Geller Cup?
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,445
There was a Geller Cup?
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,776
Yes, it was the trophy
you got if you won the game.
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:41,283
But our dad said nobody won that game,
and he was sick of our fighting.
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:44,047
So he took the trophy...
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:52,026
...threw it in the lake.
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:54,823
And was the curse lifted?
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,029
Anyway...
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:01,999
...that's why Mom said we were
not allowed to play football again.
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:05,375
You know what?
I think we should play a game.
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:07,578
I mean, come on.
It's been 12 years.
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:09,780
Can I see you for a second?
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:18,788
- Wuss!
- All right, we're gonna play.
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,482
Wait. How are we gonna get there?
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:22,854
Because my mom
won't let me cross the street.
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,460
Pheebs, here you go.
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,064
- Okay, let's bring it in.
- Wait.
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,399
Honey, throw it to me!
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,574
Here you go.
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:41,179
That almost hit me in the face!
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,178
All right, we have to pick captains.
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,681
And then Tennilles.
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,144
Okay, so how do we decide that?
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,585
- Well, why don't we just bunny up?
- What?
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,157
- Bunny!
- Bunny!
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,194
Okay, looks like Ross
and I are captains.
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:01,632
There must be a place in heaven for people
who hung out with you in high school.
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:05,966
Okay. So I bunnied first,
which means I get to pick first. Joey.
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,103
- Thank you.
- Monica!
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,105
I'm your best friend.
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,913
Sweetie, don't worry,
you'll get picked. Chandler.
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,378
- Ross!
- Phoebe.
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,716
Sweetie, now I pick you.
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:27,415
You don't pick me.
You're stuck with me!
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:29,627
Okay. All right. So let's see.
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,889
Let's play from the trash can
to the light post, right?
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,656
Two-hand touch. We'll kick off.
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:37,529
All right, people, listen.
I've got exactly 28 minutes...
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,671
...before I have to baste again.
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,965
Wow, just like in the pros.
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,107
Come on. Huddle up!
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:47,676
- All right, huddle up right over here!
- Wait for me! Wait for me!
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,279
Oh, cool! This is my first huddle.
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,217
- Okay.
- Okay.
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:55,546
So what do you guys
really think of Chandler?
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:59,817
- You know what you're doing, right?
- Yeah.
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,220
Joey's going to catch it.
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:04,157
- And you and I are going to block.
- What's block?
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:08,767
- I thought you knew what you were doing.
- I thought you meant in life.
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:10,994
Break!
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:15,038
The ball is Janice.
The ball is Janice.
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:21,710
Son of a...!
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:24,179
- Come on!
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,012
You know what?
We're just gonna throw it.
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:29,482
I got it!
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,121
Go, go, go!
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,596
Score! Seven to nothing!
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,532
Okay, honey,
just so that I'm clear on this.
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:50,641
You said in the huddle that if Joey caught
the ball, you'd be the one to stop him.
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:53,334
Now, you didn't.
So is that like a football strategy?
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:56,777
Yeah, it was part of my plan
to fall instantly behind. So...
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,210
Come on. Let's go.
00:06:58,785 --> 00:06:59,979
Losers walk.
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,847
Yeah? Losers talk.
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:05,546
No. No. No. Actually, losers rhyme.
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,026
Forty-three.
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:10,320
Seventy-four.
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:15,994
- You wanna go shotgun?
- Yeah.
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,468
- Hike.
- One Mississippi, two Mississippi...
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:22,698
Over here! Over here!
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:24,769
I almost caught that one!
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:29,438
Great. Now the score's
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,107
Okay.
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:34,411
On this play, I want you to do
a down-and-out to the right, okay?
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,449
- Break!
- Wait. What am I gonna do?
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:37,953
You?
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:39,124
You go long.
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:40,519
Well, how long?
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:43,559
- Until we start to look very small.
- Okay.
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,492
Break!
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,929
- Hike.
- One Mississippi, two Mississippi...
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,601
Switch! Switch! Switch!
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:02,874
Hey. Thanks for stopping our ball.
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:04,982
You are playing American football?
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:09,416
Yeah. Wow! You're, like,
from a whole other country!
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,080
I'm Dutch.
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,520
Hi, I'm Joey.
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:14,954
I am Margha.
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:18,753
I'm sorry, Dutch.
I didn't get that last little bit.
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,593
Hey, Joey, you wanna play
football or... Hi, I'm Chandler.
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,600
Hello, Chandler.
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:27,498
Her name is Dutch and also Margha.
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:28,874
Margha.
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,305
- Margha.
- Margha.
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:34,108
Mar-hon.
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:36,348
Margha.
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:40,610
Yo, flirty boys.
We're in the middle of a game.
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,288
Come on, guys! Let's go!
Come on. Second down!
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:47,283
- Hello? It's third down.
- No, it's not. It's second.
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,418
- Wow.
- Wow what?
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,632
How it just amazes me that
you're still pulling stuff like this.
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:59,001
- Pulling what? It's second down.
- Okay, it's second down.
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,599
Take all the second downs you need.
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:05,103
- I heard that.
- Well, I said it loud.
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:09,174
It is okay if I stay and watch?
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,815
I can't go home just yet.
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:16,421
My roommate is forshlocking
a big American businessman.
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:20,615
- Just sit right there.
- Yeah, why don't you stick around?
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,418
- Well, that went well.
- I think so.
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,595
You know, I was thinking
about asking her for her number.
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:30,631
Thanks, man, but it makes a stronger
statement if I ask for it myself, you know?
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:33,505
No. I was thinking about for me.
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:36,675
As part of that whole getting-over-Janice
thing you talked about.
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:38,605
Oh, yeah. That.
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,637
If it means that much,
I'll let you have her.
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:43,508
Thanks.
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,544
Let me have her?
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,312
What do you mean?
If you didn't, I wouldn't have a shot?
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,413
I don't like to say it out loud...
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,114
...but yeah!
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,591
Don't feel bad, man.
We all have our strengths.
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:02,427
- You're better with numbers and stuff.
- Math? You're giving me math?
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,829
All right, you know what?
Forget about it.
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:08,470
You go for the girl.
We'll see who gets her.
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:15,777
Chandler, I want you to run a
post-pattern to the left. And, sweetie...
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,174
Yeah, I know. Go long.
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:21,112
You know, it's like all I'm doing is
running back and forth from the huddle.
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:25,348
Well, you wanna just stay out there?
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:28,351
Can I see that for a second?
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,360
- Okay.
- Okay, let's go.
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,861
- I got Chandler!
- Hike!
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:38,034
One Mississippi, two Mississippi,
three Mississippi.
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,498
Fumble!
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:48,412
What the hell's the matter with you?
This is my favorite jersey.
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,342
Well, now you have two.
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,177
Hey, I am good at math!
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,549
That's it. I was still
gonna let you have her.
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,521
But now forget about it.
Prepare to feel bad about yourself.
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:04,059
Hey, well, I've been preparing
for that my entire life!
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,924
Or something about you that's mean!
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,363
All right. Come on, guys. Let's go.
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:11,398
Tie score.
We're running out of time.
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:13,996
Forty-two, 38, hike!
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,229
I got it!
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:18,970
Oh, broken boobs!
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:21,510
- Pheebs, run!
- Run, Phoebe, run!
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:24,243
Touchdown! Touchdown!
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,582
Hello, the buzzer buzzed.
It doesn't count.
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,751
- After the snap.
- Before the snap.
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:34,252
- After.
- Before.
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,221
- Now, does it really matter?
- Yes!
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:40,021
But I made a touchdown.
It was my first touchdown.
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,700
Pheebs, that's great.
Doesn't count.
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,799
- Does so count.
- Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,040
Oh, my God!
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:54,443
You know what? That's fine.
Maybe you haven't grown up, but I have.
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:57,707
- Oh, okay.
- Dead leg!
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:01,917
Okay, fine. You want to win
by cheating, go ahead, all right.
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:04,146
Phoebe, the touchdown
does count. You win.
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,615
No!
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:09,551
I'm not going
to go through this again.
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:11,662
I wanna beat you
when you can't blame...
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:15,493
...it on the broken nose or the buzzer
or the fact that you might have mono.
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:19,127
All right. Let's just call
this tie score and it's halftime.
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:20,999
First, I don't play with cheaters.
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:24,074
And second of all,
you know I had swollen glands!
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,376
You know what? I think you'll play.
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,773
Oh, really? Why's that?
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,781
Because the winner gets this.
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:35,579
The Geller Cup!
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:42,517
Is everybody else seeing a
troll doll nailed to a two-by-four?
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,787
Okay, good.
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,697
Okay, where the hell did you get that?
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,197
When you went to the hospital
for your nose...
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:55,302
...I swam into the lake
and fished it out.
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,530
That cup is mine!
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:59,939
No, it's not. You want it,
you're gonna have to win it.
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:03,239
All right. So are we not
having dinner at all?
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,440
Hey, could you please
set the timer, Margha?
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:08,552
Okay, Beefy.
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:15,291
Come on, Phoebe, let's go. Come on,
it's time to get serious. Huddle up.
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:17,491
Joey, keep your head in the game.
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:21,164
It's hard, you know?
His huddle's close to the Dutch girl.
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:26,130
Look, if I take Chandler out of the
running, will you be able to focus?
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:29,102
- What are you gonna do?
- Just make sure he catches the ball.
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,434
- I'll do the rest.
- Okay.
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,310
- Come on, you wuss!
- Okay, come on.
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,177
- Go, Chan...
- I got it!
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:37,349
Come on! This way!
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:38,483
Hi!
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,785
Look out!
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:47,083
Tackled by a girl! Bet you don't
see that every day, do you?
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:50,760
What's with the tackling?
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:52,230
What?
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:54,663
I just touched him and he went over.
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:58,870
Okay. You wanna play rough?
We can play rough.
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,972
Let's get ready to rumble!
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,111
- Go, go, go!
- Get her! Get her!
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,715
I love this game!
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,053
Hey, where'd you get that?
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,658
I went really long.
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,861
Forty-two to 21.
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:03,159
Like the turkey, Ross is done!
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:07,332
No surprise. You got to pick first,
so you got the better team.
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:10,440
You're pathetic! Why can't you
just accept that we're winning...
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,042
...because I'm better than you?
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,112
Oh, what a great argument.
Exhaling!
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:18,578
You know what? I'll prove it to you.
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:22,645
I'll trade you Joey for Rachel
and I'll still win the game.
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:26,382
Oh, that's great. There goes
my last shred of self-esteem.
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:30,024
What? The guys against the girls?
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:33,790
See that's ridiculous, Monica, because
I'm only down by three touchdowns.
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,660
Oh, then bring it on!
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,166
Unless, of course, you're afraid
you might lose to a bunch of girls.
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,807
Fine. Fine. Rachel, you're with Monica.
Joey, you're with me.
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,806
I cannot believe you are trading me.
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,742
You are going to lose.
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,543
And you are going to lose.
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:54,116
And...
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,254
Help me out.
I've never done this before.
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,422
That's good. Lose.
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,783
Lose!
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,659
Come on. Let's see what it's like
to be on a winning team for a change.
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:05,489
You're gonna let me play?
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,830
All right, then!
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,097
The game is over? We eat now?
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,270
The game's not over.
We're switching teams.
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:16,703
Yeah. Chandler finds me so intimidating
that it's better if we're on the same team.
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:19,107
All right. Okay, let's play. Let's go.
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,539
Hold on a second, Joe.
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,274
Where do Dutch people come from?
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:36,083
Well, the Pennsylvania Dutch
come from Pennsylvania.
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,720
And the other Dutch people?
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:41,625
They come from somewhere near
the Netherlands, right?
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,768
Nice try.
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:46,335
See the Netherlands
is this make-believe place...
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:49,530
...where Peter Pan
and Tinker Bell come from.
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,341
Oh, my.
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:56,071
Enough with geography for
the insane, okay. Let's play some ball.
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:59,682
- No. I'm not playing with this guy now.
- Fine with me.
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:02,877
Okay, I've had enough of this.
Let's just cut to the chase.
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,248
Heidi, which
of my boys do you like?
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,258
What are you doing?
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,754
What are you doing?
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:12,254
Which do I like?
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:16,332
Yeah, for dating, general merriment,
taking back to your windmill?
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,436
Well, if I had to choose right now...
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:22,334
...which, by the way,
I find really weird...
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,835
...I would have to say Chandler.
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,042
Yes!
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:31,712
Wait a minute. She obviously
didn't understand the question.
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:35,148
Well, why don't you have
Captain Hook explain it to her?
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,446
I'm sorry, Joey. That is my truth.
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:42,249
You hear that? That is her truth,
Mr. I'll-Let-You-Have-Her!
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:45,157
I win! You suck! I rule all!
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,489
Mini-wave in celebration of me!
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:56,998
I am now thinking I would like
to change my answer to no one.
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,373
What?
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,944
I now find you shallow...
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,340
...and a dork.
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,245
Bye-bye.
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:10,844
Nice going. You just saved
yourself a couple months of sex.
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,850
You know what? It doesn't matter,
because she picked me. Me!
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,118
Now I get the dates...
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:20,094
...and you stay home on Saturday
nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:23,496
Save the breakthroughs for therapy.
The clock is ticking.
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,431
We have no time
and we are losing to girls.
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,230
We're not gonna lose to girls.
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,839
It's 42 to 21!
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,772
This sucks!
I was just up by that much!
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:36,781
Look, let me put it this way.
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:39,348
If we lose, they will
never let us forget it.
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:43,453
Okay, and worse than that, they'll never
let the women you date forget it.
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:46,954
Hey! Are we playing football, or what?
Come on, you hairy-backed Marys!
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:51,887
We have to do this.
We are playing for women everywhere.
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:54,622
Okay, just think about
every lousy date you ever had.
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,834
Every guy who kept one eye
on the TV while you were making out.
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:01,233
Oh, my God! You dated
someone with a glass eye too?
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:07,039
Come on, okay? This is for
all womankind. Let's kill them!
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,407
Yeah! Kill them!
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,447
All right, well,
I want to kill them too.
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,982
But they're boys.
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:17,786
You know, how are we gonna
beat three boys?
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:50,184
We still have a minute and a half
left, and we're down by two points.
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:51,651
Two points, ladies.
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:59,290
Phoebe, you do a buttonhook again.
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:00,964
Rachel, you go long.
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,897
No, don't make me go long.
Use me. They never cover me.
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:06,832
Honey, there's a reason.
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,439
Monica, I'm not lame, okay?
I can do something. I can throw.
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:15,374
- Let me throw. This is my game too.
- Come on, Mon. Let her throw the ball.
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:19,277
Rachel, sweep behind, I'll pitch it to you.
You throw it downfield to Phoebe.
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:20,451
Thank you.
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:21,619
- Break!
- Break!
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,817
- All right, here we go.
- Okay.
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,387
Thirty-two, 71, hike!
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,150
One Mississippi, two Mississippi,
three Mississippi!
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:35,957
Go, go, go!
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:38,895
Mon, catch!
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:43,931
- I'm so sorry. Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay!
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:47,743
I'm sorry. They were coming at me
and I didn't know what to do.
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:49,971
Thirty seconds left on the timer.
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:53,678
You are the loser!
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,478
Okay, okay. So we get
to take that stupid troll thing home.
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,625
Come on! Come on! Hurry!
We're running out of time.
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:04,455
- Huddle up!
- Okay.
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,765
Oh, this is our last huddle!
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:11,601
All right, Phoebe, get open.
Rachel...
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:12,770
...go long.
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:14,268
Okay.
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:16,370
Break!
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,219
I did it! Touchdown!
We did it!
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:14,128
You know? Rachel, funny thing, actually.
The end zone starts at that pole.
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:16,424
So you're 5 feet short.
So...
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,334
...we win!
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:22,062
Yes, yes, yes!
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:24,242
Wait, so explain
something to me, though.
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:28,707
If nobody tagged Rachel,
then isn't the play still going?
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:36,453
- Let me in, let me in!
- No way! Let go!
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:39,886
Let go?! I'm a tiny little woman!
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:44,358
Guys, guys, come on. It's Thanksgiving!
It's not important who wins or loses.
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:47,723
The important thing
is, the Dutch girl picked me!
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:53,902
Me, not you! Holland loves Chandler!
Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:01,703
We should definitely
play football more often.
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:04,711
Maybe there's, like, a league
we could join or something.
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,783
Isn't there, like,
a national football league?
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:11,485
Yes. Yes, there is. They play
on Sundays and Monday nights.
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,250
Oh, shoot! I work Monday nights.
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,386
This stuffing is amazing.
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:23,090
- Should we should bring them some?
- When they're hungry, they'll come in.
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:26,168
- Let go!
- No, you let go!
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:31,041
How come it's always us
left on the field, holding the ball?
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:35,642
I don't know. I guess the other
people just don't care enough.
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:44,279
Hey, it's starting to snow.
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:51,756
- Give it to me! Let go!
- Let it go! Come on!
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:59,098
There was a time tonight that I
started losing the feeling in my toes.
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:01,204
- I know.
- That's when I realized...
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:04,534
...there's more important things
than beating you at football.
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,506
Things like feet.
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:10,306
Yeah, I know. This thing has
caused us too much pain and suffering.
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:12,073
- Yeah.
- It's time.
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,945
We'll just call it a tie.
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:16,347
- It's a tie.
- All right.
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:17,522
Here.
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,187
Okay.
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:27,327
- Good night.
- Good night.
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:30,928
Pheebs, did you get it?
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,331
- Yeah, I got it.
- Oh, great.
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:38,202
Bring it up. There's champagne
in my apartment for the winners.
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:41,811
- Ross! What are you doing down here?
- Nothing.
