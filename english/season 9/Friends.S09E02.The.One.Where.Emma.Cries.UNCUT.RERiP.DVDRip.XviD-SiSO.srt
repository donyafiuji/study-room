00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:04,735
You said you'd marry Joey?
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:08,305
Okay, you have to realize,
l was exhausted, l was emotional.
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:10,170
l would have said yes to anybody.
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:14,541
Like that time
when you and l got married.
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,373
l'm not helping.
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:22,144
So you said yes to him,
and you just had our baby?
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:26,348
That is right. And traditionally,
the daddy gives the mommy a present.
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,653
But l am prepared to let that go.
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:33,630
So when l came here to see if you
wanted to maybe start things up again...
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,167
...you were engaged to my best friend?
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,735
Well--
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:40,566
Really?
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:43,368
l thought Chandler
was your best friend.
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:47,035
Well, Chandler's my oldest friend.
Joey's my-- No!
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,177
Hey, l'm gonna take off.
l just wanted to say goodbye.
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,285
Rachel said she'd marry you?
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:58,154
This isn't the right room. Sorry, folks.
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:56,338
l don't want to be negative. So l'll say
most of the signs you bought are good.
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:03,917
No, they ran out of ''lt's a Girl!''
But l can fix this one.
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,961
See? Huh?
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,266
So sexy.
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:18,062
-Honey?
-Yeah?
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,573
-Honey, why don't you lie down?
-lt's okay.
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:25,733
Ross and Rachel will be back soon,
and then l gotta go to the office.
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,681
Am l producing them?
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,679
-Why are you so tired?
-l couldn't sleep last night.
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,881
l started worrying about this big
divisional meeting l have today.
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,424
The more l worried,
the more l couldn't sleep.
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:45,496
You know, and then l was, like, ''lf l fall
asleep now, l'll get six hours' sleep.
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,862
But if l fall asleep now,
l'll get five hours' sleep.''
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:51,333
No matter what l did,
l couldn't fall asleep.
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:55,167
You know what you should've done?
Told yourself that little story.
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,939
-Hi.
-Hey.
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:00,544
-Welcome home.
-Hi.
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,111
Phoebe did the signs.
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:06,846
You guys, thanks for doing this.
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:09,613
Look at all that stuff people sent.
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,350
Oh, my gosh. Look, there's something
every mother needs.
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:17,963
A giant, stuffed gorilla that takes up
the entire apartment.
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:23,433
What are people think--?
You guys, l love it.
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,566
Hey, so where's Ross?
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:29,070
He's downstairs getting the stuff
out of the cab.
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,903
-ls he still mad at us?
-Well, you more than me.
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:35,070
But he can't stay too mad at me.
l mean, l just had his baby.
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,875
That's not fair. l can't do that.
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,748
l'm not sure you should be here
when he comes up.
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:45,048
l didn't think l should be here either.
But somebody said he'd be over it.
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,818
Hey, what do l know?
l wanted to get a bigger gorilla.
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:57,796
The numbers we're seeing in Chicago,
New York and London are solid.
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:02,635
But many of our field offices
have reported disappointing yields.
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,910
Boston is down. Atlanta is down.
Houston is down.
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,882
l could go on and on.
But instead of boring you...
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:18,046
...l'll go straight to my 42-point plan.
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,592
Walter.
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,468
She's just so cute.
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:38,200
l just want to bite her ear off
and use it as a sucking candy.
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:40,777
Phoebe.
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,246
But l could take one of those little feet
and put it in a pita pocket.
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:49,621
-Okay. l put most of the stuff away.
-Oh, great. The pacifiers?
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,690
-lt's in the cupboard.
-The burping cloths?
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,857
-Linen closet.
-The diapers?
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,495
ln the hospital.
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:04,101
-Wow, you guys got a hospital? Fancy.
-No, l left the diapers at the hospital.
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,034
There's some in the bag,
but l'll run out and get some more.
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:08,400
All right, thanks.
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,872
Could you stop at the coffeehouse
and get me a muffin?
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:14,444
-Sure. What kind?
-Let me think.
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:17,378
What do l want?
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,110
What do l want?
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,255
Please, take your time.
lt's an important decision, not like...
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:28,417
...say, l don't know, deciding to marry
someone. This is about a muffin.
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,830
-Blueberry.
-Blueberry it is.
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:35,398
Thank you.
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,137
Wow, he's not letting this go, is he?
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,636
God, how long do you think
that's gonna last?
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,470
l don't know. He got over the
''We were on a break'' thing quickly.
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,479
You know what,
l can't worry about it right now.
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:52,049
Because l've got the cutie little baby.
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:57,248
l can't believe how much l love her.
l mean, l can't get enough of her.
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:59,914
Like, right now? l miss her.
l actually miss her.
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:03,125
You know, that's her?
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,799
l know. l know, but she's sleeping.
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:11,903
lt's not like when she's awake
and l can see her stretch and wiggle.
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:13,834
Oh, my God, have you seen her yawn?
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:16,907
-lt's so cute.
-l know.
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,908
When do you think
she's gonna wake up?
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,547
She told me to ring her
if she's not up by 1 1 .
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,842
She has a job interview.
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:31,655
Okay, but the clouds part
when she yawns.
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:38,797
God, look at her sleeping.
l love her so much.
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,989
-l think l'm gonna wake her up.
-Rach, no.
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:44,102
You know, you're never
supposed to wake a sleeping baby.
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,703
Well, l can do whatever l want.
l made her.
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:54,043
Come on, little girl.
Yes. Hello, Emma. Hello. Hi.
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:02,044
Well, l would say l told you so,
but she's kind of doing that for me.
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,983
l'm sorry. Mommy's so sorry.
Go back to sleep.
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,024
Go back to sleep.
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:12,755
-lt breaks your heart, doesn't it?
-lt really does.
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:16,197
How long do you think
we have to stay?
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,436
Okay, if everyone's onboard,
it's settled.
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,165
Chandler?
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,108
-Chandler?
-Yeah.
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,751
Are you onboard?
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,580
Yes.
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:39,224
Well, then problem solved.
Chandler will run our office in Tulsa.
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,950
You're gonna love Oklahoma.
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:49,395
All right. We already tried feeding her,
changing her, burping her....
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:53,696
Try this one. ''Go back in time
and listen to Phoebe.''
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,638
-All right, here's something.
-What?
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,210
lt says to try holding the baby
close to your body...
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:03,314
...and then swing her rapidly
from side to side.
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,486
Okay.
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:15,490
lt worked!
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,655
No. Just stopped to throw up
a little bit.
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,700
Mon, what am l gonna do?
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,499
lt's been hours,
and it won't stop crying.
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:33,008
-She, Rach. Not it. She.
-Yeah. l'm not so sure.
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,206
-Oh, my God, l'm losing my mind.
-Yeah, no kidding.
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:41,183
All right, this just proves no good
can come from having sex with Ross!
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:50,288
Hey, Gunther. Can l get a couple
of blueberry muffins to go?
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,555
-Diapers, huh?
-Yep.
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,666
So l guess Rachel had your baby?
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:59,065
-Yep. Can you believe it?
-Nope.
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:02,469
l can't even believe
she slept with you in the first place.
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:08,744
You mean, like....
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,715
Hey.
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,624
l know you're pissed at me,
but we have to talk about this.
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:24,728
Actually, we don't.
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,966
Fine. Okay. But l gotta say, technically,
l didn't even do anything wrong.
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,698
What? You didn't do anything wrong?
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:37,307
-l said l didn't technically.
-Okay.
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,007
Let's put aside the fact
that you ''accidentally'' ...
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:44,774
...picked up my grandmother's ring and
you ''accidentally'' proposed to Rachel.
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,851
Can l just stop you there
for a second?
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,485
When people do this:
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:51,122
l don't really know what that means.
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,024
You were saying?
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,961
And l could even understand
that you couldn't tell Rachel.
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:06,195
But why couldn't you tell me?
You had all day to, and you didn't.
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:10,433
l know. l should've.
''l'm sorry.''
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,779
Not using it right, Joe.
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:21,244
''l'm sorry.''
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,655
-l'm gonna go.
-No, come on.
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,986
-Ross, we have to get past this.
-Give me the bag.
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,357
No, l don't know what else to do.
l said l'm sorry, now....
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,522
Now you should scream at me
or curse me or hit me.
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,794
-l'm not gonna hit you.
-You'll feel better. l'll feel better.
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,564
You know you want to,
l can see it in your eyes.
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,069
-l don't.
-A little bit.
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:45,140
-No.
-Little bit.
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,405
-No.
-A little bit more.
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:51,275
-Give me the bag. Give me the bag.
-No, hit me. Hit me.
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,543
-Give me the bag. l'm not kidding.
-Hit me.
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,720
-No.
-Hit me. Hit me. Hit me!
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,433
-You ducked!
-l'm sorry! lt was a reflex!
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:15,038
-Oh, my God! This really hurts!
-l couldn't help it.
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:19,108
When a fist comes at your face,
you duck. Look.
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,772
What is the matter with you?
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:26,042
You were supposed to duck!
Why didn't you?
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,220
Let's talk on the way to the hospital.
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:32,881
Good. Yeah, maybe while we're there,
they can check your reflexes.
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:50,742
-Try feeding her again.
-l already fed her.
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:53,605
l know. That's why l said, ''Again!''
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,010
You guys,
we can't turn on each other, okay?
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,446
That's just what she wants.
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,982
-Hi.
-Hey.
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:05,449
l told you you shouldn't have
let her watch <i>Terms of Endearment</i>.
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,786
-Can l talk to you outside?
-Just stay here.
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,361
l'm gonna check her diaper.
Pheebs, you want to come?
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,363
l'm kind of part of this.
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:19,001
Actually, it's a husband-and-wife
kind of thing.
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,673
l knew l should've married Chandler.
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,003
-Okay, what's up?
-Okay.
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:29,076
You know we said it would be fun
to move to Paris for a year?
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,910
And you could study French cooking,
and l could write...
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:36,384
...and we could picnic along the Seine,
and go wine-tasting in Bordeaux.
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,682
-Yeah.
-Okay.
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:42,419
You know how people say
that Tulsa...
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,024
...is the Paris of Oklahoma?
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:50,091
What? Who says that?
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:53,833
People who have never been
to Paris?
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,704
-Well, what's going on?
-We're moving to Tulsa.
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,779
-Excuse me?
-Okay.
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,747
Ms. McKenna,
she kind of works above my boss.
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,979
-l think you actually met her.
-Don't care. Get back to Tulsa.
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:13,751
She asked me to move to Tulsa
and be president of our office there.
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:16,827
And l was sleeping
and apparently said yes.
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:20,890
-Tulsa, Oklahoma?
-The Sooner State.
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:24,231
Whatever that is.
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:27,766
Chandler, l don't even want to see
the musical <i>Oklahoma.</i>
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,806
''Oh, What a Beautiful Morning,''
''Surrey With the Fringe on Top''?
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:35,470
Are you trying to tell me we're moving
to Oklahoma or that you're gay?
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,150
l don't think l can get out of this.
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,651
-Oh, my God!
-But you don't know...
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,655
...it could be like Paris.
You can still take a cooking class...
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,658
...at Oral Roberts University.
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:53,127
All right, not that this matters, but did
they at least offer you a huge raise?
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:57,598
No. But they are going to lease us
a Ford Focus.
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:02,373
-l'll get out of it.
-Thank you.
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:04,673
-What is wrong with Emma?
-She misunderstood.
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,005
She thought she was moving to Tulsa.
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:14,212
Ma'am, do you have a minute?
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:18,789
l kind of have some bad news.
l don't think l can move to Tulsa.
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:24,024
-What?
-lt's a funny story, actually.
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:28,131
l kind of fell asleep
in the meeting this morning.
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,827
So when l said l'd move to Tulsa,
l didn't really know what l was saying.
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,197
You fell asleep?
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:36,067
But only because l was up all night
worried about this meeting.
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:37,641
lsn't that funny?
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:42,139
lrony. Not a fan? All right.
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:45,481
See, here's the thing.
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:49,109
l went home and told my wife
about Tulsa, and she won't go.
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:53,156
See me, l love Tulsa. Tulsa is heaven.
Tulsa is ltaly.
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,350
Please don't make me go there.
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:58,563
-Chandler, l--
-l know that you're upset...
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:02,394
...but l just-- l would really
rather just stay here.
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,969
Not here in your office...
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:07,969
...here at the company...
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,268
...where l'm rapidly feeling unwelcome.
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:15,137
No, look, Carol.
Can l call you Carol?
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,150
Why would l
when your name is Elaine?
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,315
What a great picture of your son.
Strapping.
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:32,455
That's a picture of your daughter,
isn't it?
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:36,396
Well, she's lovely.
l like a girl with a strong jaw.
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,768
l'll call you from Tulsa.
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,303
Hey. So how is it?
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,416
-l broke my thumb.
-Your thumb?
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,650
That's weird.
Are you sure you're punching right?
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:00,451
Make a fist.
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,151
Maybe later.
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,058
Ross, l feel terrible.
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:09,860
You know what, you can go.
l just have to fill out some forms.
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,237
You want me to help you with that?
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:20,241
Why, does it look like l'm having
trouble with my misshapen claw?
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:25,809
Name?
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:30,053
No, l know Ross.
But what's it short for?
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,349
You know, like Rossell.
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:36,759
Or Rosstrophor.
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:39,554
Just Ross.
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,258
lt's pretty.
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:46,234
-Okay, date of birth?
-You know my birthday.
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:48,566
Sure.
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:53,003
May...tember?
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:58,578
-October 1 <i>8</i>.
-Occupation? Dinosaurs.
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:05,716
Actually, l'm a paleon--
Dinosaurs is fine.
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:09,186
The drawing is not.
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:15,697
All right, who do you want
as your emergency contact?
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:20,034
-Rachel, l guess.
-Okay. Relationship?
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:23,072
Boy, this could take a while.
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,405
-Just put roommate.
-Come on.
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:32,072
You guys are more than that.
You're gonna get together, right?
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:34,252
l don't think that we are.
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,549
But you two are supposed
to be together.
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:41,954
Well, l thought so too.
But then she said she'd marry you.
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:44,625
Come on, Ross,
that didn't mean anything.
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:47,664
She'd just had the baby. She was
freaked out about doing it alone.
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:51,894
-She would have said yes to anybody.
-Yeah, that's what she said.
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,438
-So?
-So l don't want to be just anybody.
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,168
-Wow.
-You know what?
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:03,439
lt's better this way anyway.
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,651
l don't know what l was thinking,
going down that road again with us.
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:13,486
lt's just much easier if we're
just friends who have a kid.
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:15,751
-Really?
-Yeah.
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:19,859
-And you're okay with that?
-Yes. That's what we always planned.
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:22,557
And if you have a plan,
you should stick to it.
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:26,169
That's why they call them plans.
Hello?
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:30,470
l'm fine.
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:33,072
Hey, for what it's worth...
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:37,840
...with Rachel, l don't think
you'll ever be just ''anybody.''
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,349
Hey, there you go.
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,546
''Thanks.''
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:53,186
Oh, my God.
How long has she been crying?
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:55,799
About a week and a half.
00:18:56,034 --> 00:19:00,596
Well, it looks like you guys got it
under control, so l'm just gonna go.
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:05,105
No? Really?
Misery really does love company?
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,505
All right.
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,009
-Try holding her a different way.
-Look, l'm doing the best l can.
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:15,347
-Anyone else is welcome to try.
-All right, l'll try. Fine.
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,853
-Yes. Okay. Okay.
-Here you go.
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:20,719
Hey. Oh, gosh.
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:24,056
Nothing works with this child!
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:28,131
God, what am l gonna do, you guys?
l can't even comfort my own baby.
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,029
-l'm the worst mother ever.
-No, you're just new at this.
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:34,434
You'll get better. Think about
your first day at work.
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:37,097
That couldn't have been easy,
but you figured that out.
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:42,041
Yeah, l don't think dressing
provocatively is going to help me here!
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:45,876
-God, just please take her.
-Okay, l'll take her. Come on.
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:48,986
Oh, boy,
l have to go to the bathroom.
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:52,248
l have to go scream into a pillow.
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:59,957
Bouncy. Bouncy baby. Bouncy baby.
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:04,967
Oh, baby, baby. Oh, baby, baby.
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:08,470
Oh, baby, baby, baby.
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:12,871
Have l gone deaf?
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:20,774
lt worked. Oh, baby, baby, baby.
Oh, baby, baby, baby.
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:23,614
You must be a fireball in bed!
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:31,126
l can't believe it. She's asleep.
l got her to go to sleep.
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:33,696
l have actual magical powers.
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:38,158
l can hear traffic and birds.
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,965
l can hear the voices in my head again.
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,136
l'm kidding.
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,814
Oh, my God!
You got her to stop crying!
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:56,147
Yes, l did. l'm Monica, super aunt.
00:20:56,655 --> 00:21:01,285
-You are the official baby-crier stopper.
-Yes, l am.
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:04,985
-You're never leaving the apartment.
-Say what?
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:09,530
That's your new job, day or night.
She starts crying, l need you here.
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:13,466
-No, no, no.
-Thankfully, you don't need me at all.
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:17,735
So okay. Hey, super aunt?
See you later.
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:21,504
Rachel?
Let's give it six to eight months.
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,151
Okay, so listen,
l'm gonna go lay down.
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,083
What?
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:38,228
The book says whenever
she's sleeping, l should be sleeping.
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,830
So....
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,065
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,336
Hey.
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:52,705
-We just got her to go to sleep.
-So there can't be any yelling?
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,873
No.
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:02,747
-We're moving to Tulsa.
-What?
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:09,020
l can't-- l can't hear.
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:18,560
-Hey.
-Hey. Where have you been?
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:24,064
-What happened to you?
-l had a little thing with Joey.
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,540
lf you think this is bad,
you should see him.
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:30,378
No, Ross, this is not good.
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:34,986
We have to talk about this Joey thing.
Please sit.
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:41,753
All right, you have got to get over
this Joey thing.
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:47,290
Okay? l never really wanted
to marry Joey, okay?
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,293
Okay.
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:54,766
You know what l really, really want?
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:59,376
What, Rach?
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:02,603
l wanna sleep.
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:09,018
l wanna eat.
l wanna take a shower.
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:13,418
l mean, before she wakes up,
and we gotta do this all over again.
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:16,857
-Right.
-l mean, because l got news for you.
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:20,191
Emma: not easy.
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:24,830
Well, that's what l'm here for.
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:31,266
-You want me to get that?
-No, that's really okay.
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:36,005
-Monica?
-Got it, got it, got it, got it.
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:49,120
l've been thinking about this.
And l gotta tell you, it's not my fault.
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:51,888
-lt's a natural instinct.
-What are you talking about?
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,997
Okay, what would you do if l did this?
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:06,333
