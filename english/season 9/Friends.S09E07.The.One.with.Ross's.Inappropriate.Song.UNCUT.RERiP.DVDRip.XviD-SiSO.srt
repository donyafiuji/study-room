00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:07,234
And that's why,
no matter what Mommy says...
00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:11,473
...we really were on a break.
Yes, we were.
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:15,478
Yes, we were.
Come here, gorgeous.
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:20,308
Look at you.
You are the cutest little baby ever.
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:24,321
You're just a little-bitty baby,
you know that? But you've got....
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:26,482
You've got big, beautiful eyes.
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:30,790
Yes, you do. And a....
And a big, round belly.
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:34,897
Big baby butt.
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:38,468
l like big butts.
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:55,986
Oh, my God, Emma.
You're laughing.
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:59,420
Oh, my God. You've never
done that before, have you?
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:03,255
You've never done that before.
Daddy made you laugh, huh?
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,991
Well, Daddy and Sir Mix-A-Lot.
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:10,197
What? What?
You wanna hear some more?
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,838
l'm a terrible father.
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:12,854
-What do you know about investments?
-How come?
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:16,934
l'm starting to make good money on the
show, and l should do something with it.
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:21,267
-What do you do with your money now?
-lt's taped to the back of my toilet tank.
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:25,571
l didn't say that.
lt's in a bank guarded by robots.
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,978
-Do you have any ideas?
-A guy at work got me excited...
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:33,311
...about going in on an emu farm.
That'd be kind of cool, huh?
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:37,114
Pitching in on the weekends,
helping to plant the emus.
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:42,420
Joe, emus are birds.
You raise them for meat.
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:43,926
Yeah. Right!
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,627
People eat birds. Bird meat.
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:52,293
Do they just fly into your mouth?
Or you go in a restaurant and say:
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:55,635
''Excuse me, l'll have
a bucket of fried bird.''
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:58,936
Or maybe just a wing. Or a....
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,506
You should consider something
a little less risky.
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:07,148
l think real estate is
your best investment.
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:12,652
The Fed just lowered the rates, and the
interest on your mortgage is deductible.
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:15,225
That's right. l know some stuff.
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:16,986
Real estate, huh?
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,858
And you know who's selling
a great apartment? Richard!
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:23,935
And you know whose knowledge of
her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:28,806
-My dad told me. They play golf together.
-Well, maybe l'll join them sometime.
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:31,637
l just hope the club doesn't
slip out of my hand...
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:35,042
...and beat the mustache
off his face.
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:45,680
And then the doctor said Emma
has doubled her birth weight...
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:50,227
...she is in the 90th percentile and she's
gonna start eating solid foods soon.
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:53,092
-That's great!
-l know!
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,065
-What did we used to talk about?
-No idea.
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:02,437
Hi! You have to help me pick a dress.
l'm meeting Mike's parents tonight.
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:05,471
Wow, the boyfriend's parents.
That's a big step.
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:10,475
-Really? That hadn't occurred to me.
-They'll love you. Just be yourself.
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,413
They live on the Upper East Side
on Park Avenue.
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,111
Yeah, she can't be herself.
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:19,315
Okay, so, all right, which dress?
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,958
-You can say neither.
-Oh, God. Neither.
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,532
You can say it nicely.
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:32,193
l'm sorry. We'll take you shopping.
lt'll be fine.
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:35,967
You are in such good hands,
and l am so good with meeting parents.
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:39,667
With the father, you wanna flirt a little,
but not in a gross way.
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:44,010
Just kind of like, ''Mr. Pinzer, l can
see where Wallace gets his good looks.''
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:48,552
-You went out with Wallace Pinzer?
-He took the SATs for me.
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:54,517
-l knew you didn't get a 1 400!
-Yeah, well, duh! l mean....
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:57,227
So now, what about with Mike's mom?
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,764
Well, with the mother, just constantly
tell her how amazing her son is.
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:05,597
Take it from me. Moms love me.
Ross' mom one time actually said...
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,707
...l am like the daughter
that she never had.
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:17,410
-She said what?
-She's like the daughter she never had.
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,608
Listen.
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:32,325
l just got Phoebe all dressed
to meet Mike's parents.
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,796
She's so nervous. lt's so sweet.
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,094
Guess what. l made Emma laugh today.
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,003
You what? And l missed it...
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,836
...because l was giving a makeover
to that stupid hippie?!
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,808
Yeah, and it was like
a real little person laugh too.
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:50,778
lt was like:
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:00,790
Only not creepy.
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,259
-What did you do to make her laugh?
-l....
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,092
Well, l sang. Actually...
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:09,826
...l rapped...
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,364
...''Baby Got Back.''
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,303
You what?
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:18,841
You sang to our baby daughter...
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:21,980
...a song about a guy
who likes to have sex...
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,673
...with women with giant asses?
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,876
You know what,
if you think about it...
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:31,489
...it actually promotes
a healthy body image...
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:34,023
...because even big butts...
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:37,492
...or ''juicy doubles'' are....
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:44,526
Please don't take her away from me.
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:53,574
Hi, come on in.
l'm Catherine, the listing agent.
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,304
Hi, l'm Joey. This is Chandler.
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:59,212
So how come Richard's selling
the place? Went bankrupt?
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:03,151
Medical malpractice?
Choked on his own mustache?
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:08,491
He's buying a much bigger place.
lt's got a great view of Central Park--
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,219
That's enough out of you.
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:13,092
ls there anything we should know
about the place?
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:17,760
All the appliances are included.
There's a lot of light, a new kitchen.
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:22,135
l think you guys would be
very happy here.
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:30,875
No, we're not together.
We're definitely not a couple.
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:34,075
-Okay. Sorry.
-That's all right.
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,450
Wow, you seemed
pretty insulted by that.
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:40,188
What, l'm not good enough for you?
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,852
We are not gonna have
this conversation again.
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:48,558
Look at this place.
Why am l so intimidated by this guy?
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:52,465
Pretentious art.
This huge, macho couch.
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,936
When we know
all he does is sit around...
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:58,770
...crying about losing Monica
to a real man.
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,743
-You don't think he's here, do you?
-l don't know.
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:06,977
lt's a nice place, but l gotta say,
l don't know if l see myself living here.
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,086
Well, let me see.
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:18,393
Yeah, l can see it.
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:22,725
Look at these videos.
l mean, who does he think he is?
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:26,429
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:28,267
-Oh, my God.
-What?
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:31,809
There's a tape here
with Monica's name on it.
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:35,971
A tape with a girl's name on it.
lt's probably a sex tape.
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,649
Wait a minute.
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:41,116
This says ''Monica.''
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,620
And this is Richard's apartment.
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:48,958
Get there faster!
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,338
Wow. You look...
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,381
...like my mom.
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,547
l'm wearing pantyhose.
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,949
-Great! Come on in.
-Okay.
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:23,893
Thank you.
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:27,326
-Oh, my God. You're rich.
-No, my parents are rich.
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,958
Well, so? They gotta die someday.
Hello!
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,797
Mom, Dad, this is Phoebe.
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,736
Phoebe, these are my parents,
Theodore and Bitsy.
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,398
Theodore, Bitsy...
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,678
...what a delight.
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:46,075
-lt's so nice to finally meet you.
-And you.
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,583
Your home is lovely.
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:52,646
Thank you. l'll give you a tour later.
lt's actually three floors.
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:54,689
Holy crap!
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,362
Why don't you come meet our friends.
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,667
Try and stop me.
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:05,497
-What are you doing?
-Trying to get your parents to like me.
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:08,367
l'm sure they will,
but you don't have to do this.
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,305
l want them to get to know Phoebe,
not ''Phoebe.''
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,944
lt is fun, though, isn't it?
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,574
-You've got it.
-All right.
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,775
lt's hard to stop.
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,344
Well, come on.
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:26,013
Phoebe, these are our friends
Tom and Sue Engel.
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:29,821
Phoebe, come sit.
Tell us a little bit about yourself.
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,692
-So where are you from?
-Okay.
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:36,425
Well, all right.
Originally, l'm from upstate...
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:41,005
...but then my mom killed herself,
and my stepdad went to prison.
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:45,735
So l moved to the city, where l lived in
a burned-out Buick LeSabre for a while.
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:48,072
Which was okay. That was okay.
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,942
Until l got hepatitis, you know...
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,677
...because this pimp spit
in my mouth and....
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,554
But l got over it.
00:10:56,722 --> 00:11:01,716
And, anyway, now l'm
a freelance massage therapist...
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:06,263
...which isn't always steady money,
but at least l don't pay taxes.
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,934
So where does everyone summer?
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:23,412
l'm not gonna watch it.
l don't need to watch it.
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:26,278
l mean, what good could
possibly come from watching it?
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,315
Well, we know l'm gonna watch it.
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:35,255
-Hey, dude, what's up?
-Don't judge me! l'm only human!
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,461
Did you take that tape?
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:41,225
l had to! lmagine you were married
and you found a tape of your wife...
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,801
...in another guy's apartment. Wouldn't
you need to know what was on it?
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,768
l don't know. Who am l married to?
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:50,965
Some girl.
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,440
She hot?
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,514
How did she get me to settle down?
00:11:58,184 --> 00:11:59,981
All right, l'm gonna watch it.
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:03,019
l mean, it's probably
not even what l think it is.
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:07,387
Even if it is, it can't possibly be as
bad as what l'm picturing in my head.
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,892
Can it?
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:13,730
ln my experience,
if a girl says yes to being taped...
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,493
...she doesn't say no to much else,
l'll tell you.
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:21,202
-Then you have to watch it for me.
-What?
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:24,035
Just for a few seconds
so l can know what it is. Please?
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:28,709
All right, fine. But if l enjoy this,
you have only yourself to blame!
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:38,514
-Why am l hearing cheering?
-lt's okay. lt's just a football game.
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:42,954
-lt's just football?
-You were all worried for nothing.
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,029
lt's football! lt's just football!
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:48,325
This is great! This is the first time
l've ever enjoyed football!
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:51,061
l think it may be customary to get a beer.
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,803
What the...?
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,703
-What are you doing?
-You don't wanna see what l just saw!
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:03,204
What are you guys doing?
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:06,317
Oh, my God! ls that Richard?
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:15,518
-Oh, God, this is not going well.
-No, you're doing fine. Really.
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:19,289
-Why don't you go talk to my dad.
-Okay, okay, okay.
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,025
-Still sure about me being myself?
-Absolutely.
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,567
Though maybe just
a little less ''pimp spit.''
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:34,408
So, Theodore, l can see
where Mike gets his good looks from.
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:36,845
Well....
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:41,815
-You must work out all the time.
-Not all the time. l do the best l can.
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,421
Yeah, l bet. Look out!
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:48,291
-Oh, my God. Are you okay?
-l recently had surgery.
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,262
-l'm so sorry.
-No, l'll be fine.
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,490
-l just should check the stitches.
-l really am sorry.
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:58,728
How could you know? Why wouldn't
you punch me in the stomach?
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,869
Did you just hit my dad?
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:08,104
Yes. l'm sorry. l've never met
a boyfriend's parents before.
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,942
But, l mean, you have met
humans before, right?
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:13,417
Why don't you go talk to my mom.
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:16,953
Okay, yeah, your mom.
She looks nice. l can talk to her.
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:21,991
You do that, and l'm gonna go check
my dad for signs of internal bleeding.
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:27,965
Bitsy? Listen, l wanted to thank you
again for having me here tonight.
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,361
Well, not at all.
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:33,130
Also, l just want you to know
what a wonderful man your son is.
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:37,867
-Thank you. l think so too.
-lt's a testament to how he was raised.
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:41,069
Especially to you,
because he's very respectful of women.
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:45,047
-ls he really?
-He is so considerate of my feelings.
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:50,211
You know, l think you'd also like
to know that he is a very gentle lover.
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,061
Excuse me?
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,755
No, don't get me wrong.
No, not in like a sissy way.
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,763
When he gets going...
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:06,064
...he can rattle a headboard
like a sailor on leave.
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,207
That's...my boy.
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,243
Awesome.
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:26,347
Okay, please laugh for Mommy.
Please?
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,820
Please laugh for Mommy.
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,666
Not funny, huh?
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,801
Well, so is it...
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:40,962
...only offensive novelty rap?
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:45,007
Or maybe just, you know, rap in general.
Because Mommy can rap.
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:53,977
l can't rap.
00:15:55,788 --> 00:16:00,885
All right, sweetheart. This is
only because l love you so much.
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:05,721
And l know that you're
not gonna tell anybody.
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:41,359
Emma, you're laughing! You are!
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:46,197
You really do like big butts, don't you?
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:50,331
You beautiful little weirdo.
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:54,245
You missed it! She was laughing!
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:55,710
lt was amazing.
00:16:56,081 --> 00:17:00,142
lt was amazing. lt was the most
beautiful, beautiful sound.
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,844
l know, isn't it?
What'd you do to get her to laugh?
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:09,190
You know, l just....
A couple of things l tried. Different....
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,727
Just sang a little
''The ltsy-Bitsy Spider.''
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:15,594
You sang ''Baby Got Back,'' didn't you?
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:20,268
Nothing else worked!
That girl is all about the ass!
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,941
And then it goes back to the chorus.
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:31,241
Resolve.
And that's the end of the song.
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,945
l realize you hadn't asked
to hear it...
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:38,681
...but no one had spoken
in 1 7 minutes.
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:44,794
Phoebe writes lots of songs. What was
that one you sang the other night?
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:46,693
''Pervert Parade''?
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:52,693
-''Ode to a Pubic Hair''?
-Stop.
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,769
Oh, God. ls that veal?
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:02,469
Mom, l thought l told you,
Phoebe's a vegetarian.
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:06,616
No, that's okay. That's okay.
l mean, l am a vegetarian...
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:10,414
...except for veal.
Yeah. No. Veal l love.
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:15,218
-Phoebe, you don't have to eat that.
-Any baby animals. Kittens, fish babies.
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:18,087
But, you know, especially veal.
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:22,298
You know, and this nice vein of fat
running through it.
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,610
Yummy.
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,853
So...
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,996
...what do you think?
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,395
So you stole that tape
from Richard's apartment?
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,408
Listen to the judgment
from the porn star!
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:09,178
That tape was never meant
to be seen by....
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:13,250
Joey, l would feel more comfortable
if this conversation were in private.
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:18,515
Monica, look, l don't think you and l
have any secrets anymore.
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:22,151
Not ready to joke about it yet?
See you later.
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:26,361
Why in the world would you take this tape?
And why would you watch it?
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,898
Because that's who l am. Okay?
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:33,266
l'm sure a man like Richard could see
a tape like that and not be bothered.
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,838
lt'd just be another saucy anecdote...
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:40,172
...for him to share at his men's club
over brandy and mustaches.
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:44,247
ls all of this about you not being able
to grow a mustache?
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,219
This is about you and Richard.
He's clearly not over you.
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:51,220
He keeps a tape so he can
look at it whenever he wants.
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:55,121
lsn't that sad?
Can't you see how pathetic that is?
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,795
Don't be jealous.
You should feel bad for him.
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,761
Yeah, well, poor Richard, he....
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:03,128
l can grow a mustache.
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:09,272
This is not our problem. We have
each other. That's all that matters.
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:14,608
But l just keep picturing you rolling
around with him, with your...
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,645
...cowboy boots in the air.
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:22,550
Cowboy boots? l've never worn
cowboy boots in my whole life.
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:26,053
Good, good. Play more
because l wanna see how it ends.
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:31,225
-That's not me!
-What?
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,724
That's not you! Life is good again!
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,161
Ride 'em, cowgirl!
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:42,228
That bastard taped over me!
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:46,304
ls that a problem?
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:50,737
lt's just so insulting.
Spring for a new blank tape, doctor!
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,886
Yes, but the important thing is
that we have each other, right?
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,989
Well, yeah. lt's just so rude!
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:05,624
-And the way we did it was a lot better--
-Are you going to finish that sentence?
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,592
l can't imagine what he sees in her.
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:12,362
She actually makes me miss
that pill-popping ex-wife of his.
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:15,263
Hello, dear.
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,744
-What's going on?
-We were just chitchatting.
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:22,675
-How's your friend?
-A little better.
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:27,451
Do you know who's moving back into
town? Tom and Sue's daughter, Jen.
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:32,214
You remember her, Michael.
She's lovely, well-behaved and single.
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:36,520
-l'm not interested.
-Please, darling, let's be honest.
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:40,688
You can have all the sailor fun
you want with that one.
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:42,925
-But let's be real.
-All right, stop.
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:47,595
All Phoebe has done is try and get you
to like her. Maybe it's not clear...
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,296
...but she did her best.
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:54,434
-She's a little different than you are.
-Michael, a pimp spit in her mouth.
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:59,615
So what? lf l can get past that,
it shouldn't bother you.
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:02,982
You don't have to like her.
Just accept the fact that l do.
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,622
lf you can't even be civil
to the woman l love--
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:09,693
-The woman you what?
-Yeah, the woman you what?
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:13,694
The woman l love.
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,601
l love you.
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,104
Something l shouldn't say for
the first time, in front of my parents...
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:28,439
...and Tom and Sue.
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:34,245
Who are, by the way, the most sinfully
boring people l've ever met in my life.
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,721
-l love you too.
-You do?
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,317
How great is this?
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:47,655
Wanna get out of here?
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:52,432
-Mom, Dad. Thanks for dinner.
-l had a great time.
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:56,700
lt was really top-drawer.
And here's something rich.
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:01,244
Thirteen bathrooms in this place,
l threw up in the coat closet.
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:02,640
Ta-ta!
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:26,737
One more time from the top!
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:37,305
Rachel, please!
That is so inappropriate!
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,840
