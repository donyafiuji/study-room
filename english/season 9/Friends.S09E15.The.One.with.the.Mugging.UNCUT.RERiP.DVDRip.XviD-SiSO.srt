00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:04,498
Guys! Guys! l've got great
news. Guess what.
00:00:05,238 --> 00:00:07,069
-Monica's pregnant!
-Really?
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,602
Let's get past the moment.
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:13,639
-What's your news?
-Thank you.
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,071
l got a job in advertising.
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,281
Honey, that's incredible!
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:22,751
Gosh, what's the pay like?
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:26,521
Oh, come on, people.
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:28,921
lf l don't know who makes the most...
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:32,428
...how do l know who
l like the most? Hi, Joey.
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:35,935
lt pays nothing. lt's an internship.
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:38,001
We have interns at <i>Days of Our Lives</i>.
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:41,264
Right. So it'll be the same,
except less sex with you.
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:45,369
What do you think they'll
have you do there?
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:48,740
lt's a training program, but they
hire the people they like.
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:51,883
-That's great!
-There's gonna be some grunt work...
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:55,681
...which will stink. A grown man
getting people coffee is humiliating.
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,560
Humiliating and noble.
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:04,028
Thank you.
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:07,859
You know, if l didn't
already have a job...
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:10,127
...l would've been good in advertising.
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:13,032
Ross, you did not come up with:
''Got Milk?''
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,207
Yes, l did! l did!
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,906
l should've written it down.
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,595
Where's Chandler? l want to wish
him good luck on his first day.
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,268
And l smelled bacon.
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:19,666
-He just left.
-Who did?
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,976
Joey, you're never gonna
believe it! She called!
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:25,735
-She did?
-You got it!
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,540
-l did?
-What is she talking about?
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,975
l don't know, but it sounds great!
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,311
Your agent called.
You got that audition!
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:33,850
-With Leonard Hayes?
-Yes!
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,717
Oh, my God, that is great!
lt's for a play on Broadway.
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:42,021
And in a real theater. Not that little
one underneath the deli like last time.
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,854
-ls it a good play?
-lt must be.
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,625
l read it and didn't
understand a single word!
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,530
-Leonard Hayes is starring in it.
-Yeah, and directing.
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,204
He was so good in
that movie of <i>Macbeth</i>.
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:57,206
-You saw that?
-No, but l saw the previews.
00:02:57,377 --> 00:03:00,574
They played it right before <i>Jackass</i>.
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,146
-He's done some amazing work.
-Oh, yeah.
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,511
l loved him in those phone commercials.
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:09,587
When the monkey hits him in the face
with the giant rubber phone....
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:11,687
Maybe the monkey
will be at the audition.
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:15,657
Don't make me more nervous
than l already am!
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:27,368
-Good morning.
-Can l get you a cup of coffee, sir?
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,509
Oh, no, no. l'm an intern,
just like you guys.
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:35,239
Except for the tie, the briefcase
and the fact that l can rent a car.
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,245
Seriously, you're an intern?
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:41,546
l'm heading in a new career direction
and you gotta start at the bottom.
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,212
Dude.
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:49,857
l know l'm a little older than you guys,
but it's not like l'm Bob Hope.
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,892
The comedian. USO.
00:03:56,536 --> 00:04:00,028
lt's U.S.A., sir.
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,938
This is Joey Tribbiani.
Joey, these are the producers.
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:12,084
And as you probably already
know, this is Leonard Hayes.
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:21,250
lt is so amazing to meet you.
l am such a big fan of your work.
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,294
l've been blessed with
a lot of great roles.
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:29,634
Tell me about it, huh?
''Unlimited nights and weekends!''
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:34,102
Are you making fun of me?
Because l am not a sellout.
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:36,969
l didn't do it for money.
l believe in those phones!
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:41,512
l almost lost a cousin because
of bad wireless service.
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:45,844
No, l wasn't making fun of you. l think
you were great in those commercials.
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,350
-Really?
-Yeah.
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,614
Well, l do bring a certain
credibility to the role.
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,989
Are you kidding? When they shoot
you out of that cannon--
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,492
''Hang up that phone!''
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,828
-One take.
-Wow.
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:05,027
-So shall we read?
-Oh, yeah, sure.
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:09,265
Top of Act 2. This is my entrance.
You got it?
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,440
What the hell are you still doing here?
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:20,417
-l think you know.
-Bastard!
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,112
l am what you made me.
You know what? l could go right now.
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,986
-Go! Go!
-l can't.
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,857
Oh, l want to, Long Pause...
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:35,159
...but l can't.
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:42,065
So sorry. You're not supposed
to say ''long pause.''
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:48,147
Oh! Oh, l thought that was your
character's name. You know?
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:51,806
l thought you were, like, an lndian
or something, you know, with the....
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:57,683
No. Thank you so much for coming in.
We appreciate it. Thank you.
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,688
You don't want me to do it again?
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,486
-l could do an accent.
-No.
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:06,724
You know, Southern.
''l could go right now, mon!'' Huh?
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,667
My God in heaven.
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:17,108
Joey, hang on. Leonard, can
we talk to you for a moment?
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:23,476
Yes? You've got to be kidding.
He can't act.
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,378
l don't care if you think he's hot.
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:30,215
lf you want to sleep with him,
do it on your own time. This is a play.
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,685
lf you insist on this...
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,884
...l will call my agent so fast...
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,895
...on a cell phone connection so clear,
he's gonna think l'm next door!
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:45,295
Hi, thank you so much for
whispering for my benefit.
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:49,941
Tell me what l did wrong. l'd love to
work on it and try it again for you.
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,304
And also, how you doing?
00:06:55,782 --> 00:07:00,276
Give me another chance.
l really want to get better. Please?
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:04,051
lf you want to come back today...
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:05,952
-...here are my notes. Ready?
-Yeah.
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:11,893
-You're in your head. Thinking too much.
-l really doubt that.
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,795
No, no. lt's that you're not
connected with anything in your body.
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,230
There's no urgency.
The scene is a struggle.
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:21,931
lt's a race.
Also, what you did was horizontal.
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,043
Don't be afraid to explore the vertical.
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:30,472
And don't learn the words.
Let the words learn you.
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,346
Couldn't l just sleep with the producer?
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,128
Hey, do you want to go
to dinner tonight?
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:55,138
l can't. l've got a date
with that waitress, Katie.
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,471
l know we've only gone out,
like, twice, but l don't know...
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:03,581
-...l have a good feeling about her.
-Oh, l hear divorce bells.
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,478
Give me your wallets,
and there won't be a problem.
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,415
-What?
-l have a gun.
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,817
Okay, relax, Phoebe.
Just stay calm.
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:16,227
Oh, my God, l can't find my wallet!
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:21,894
-All right, lady, now give me your purse.
-No.
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:26,197
What do you mean ''no''? l knew you'd
be my death, Phoebe Buffay!
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,906
-Lowell, is that you?
-Phoebe?
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:34,773
-Oh, my God!
-Unbelievable! Oh, my God!
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:39,407
l'm sorry. Ross, this is my old friend,
Lowell, from the streets!
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:42,019
-Lowell, Ross.
-Ross, nice to meet you.
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:44,348
Yeah, a real pleasure.
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:48,754
lt's been so long! Oh, so long.
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:52,419
-l can't believe you're still doing this.
-l know. But l quit smoking.
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:54,395
Good for you.
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,262
You look like you're doing well.
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:59,063
l guess your mugging days
are behind you.
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:02,605
Oh, my God.
Phoebe, you used to mug people?
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,045
Excuse me, Ross,
old friends catching up.
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:15,909
-How'd the audition go?
-They want to see me again, but...
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:18,818
...Leonard Hayes did not like me.
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:22,654
-What happened?
-He said l wasn't urgent enough.
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:28,664
Everything l did was horizontal,
and l should be more vertical.
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:34,464
-He said that l should think less.
-Well, so far so good.
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,801
Honey, l'm old!
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,039
l didn't know you were
coming home for lunch.
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:43,272
-Can l get you anything?
-Sure, a tube of Polident?
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,241
Some Depends?
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,819
Birthday wishes from Willard Scott.
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:50,546
What's wrong?
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:54,351
l am so much older than these other
interns. l can't compete with them.
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:56,392
So you're a little older.
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:59,429
Look at the positive.
You have all this life experience.
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:05,195
Yes, but l don't think life experience
is gonna help me with these.
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:11,309
Wow! lt's like they're on fire!
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:18,239
-What are they?
-Prototype sneakers.
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,908
l need ideas on how to sell them.
Which l can't do...
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,715
...because no self-respecting
adult would ever wear these.
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,515
l'll give you $500 for them.
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:32,621
-What am l supposed to do?
-Come on, sneakers are easy.
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:36,495
-You wear them all the time.
-They're not called sneakers anymore.
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:42,608
They're called ''kicks'' or ''skids.''
l think l heard somebody say ''slorps.''
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,909
They've got wheels that pop out from
the bottom so you can roll around...
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,481
...because apparently
walking is too much exercise.
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:56,054
''Kids! Kids! Roll your
way to childhood obesity!''
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:01,154
Kids today have such
an easier time getting fat.
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,858
Would you help me try to sell these?
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:11,093
Okay. Have you considered
using a girl with huge knockers?
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:13,769
That's not what they're looking for.
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:16,498
Hey, that would work on me.
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,735
Why do you think l buy
Mrs. Butterworth's?
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,753
You'll never guess what just happened.
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:34,586
-Phoebe and l got mugged!
-Are you okay?
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:37,388
Yeah. Phoebe knew the mugger.
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,629
How do you know a mugger?
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:44,098
l'm sorry, l have friends
outside the six of us.
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,398
Know how she knew him?
Because Phoebe used to mug people.
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:49,301
Seriously?
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:53,002
Well, l'm not proud of it,
but, you know...
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:58,412
...when l was living on the street and
l needed money for food and stuff....
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:02,485
-That is awful.
-l wasn't rich like you guys, okay?
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:06,716
l didn't eat gold and have a flying pony.
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,055
l had a hard life.
My mother was killed by a drug dealer.
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:16,030
-Your mother killed herself.
-She was a drug dealer.
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:21,829
lt was a good thing she knew him.
l was about to do some serious damage.
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,440
Okay.
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:28,069
This must have brought back
some bad memories for you, Ross.
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:31,078
-Why?
-Ross was mugged as a kid.
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:34,548
-You were?
-Yeah. And it was pretty traumatic.
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,881
lt was outside St. Mark's Comics.
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:42,050
l was minding my business, seeing what
kind of trouble Spider-Man was into.
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,320
Wonder Woman.
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,591
Anyway, l was heading
towards this bakery...
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:52,466
...to pick up a couple of dozen
linzer tortes for someone...
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,698
...when out of nowhere, this thug
with a pipe jumps out and says:
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:00,175
-''Give me your money, punk!''
-Oh, my God.
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:03,213
l know. And the worst part
was, they took my backpack...
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:09,218
...which had all the original artwork l did
for my own comic book, <i>Science Boy</i>.
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:12,589
Oh, yeah! What was
his super power again?
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,693
A super-human thirst for knowledge.
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,421
l better get to class.
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:22,795
Are there any more of your
friends l should look out for?
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:26,095
No. Actually, you might want to stay
away from Jane Street.
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:30,003
That's where Stabby Joe works.
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,778
-l think we have a problem here.
-What?
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:41,112
Back in my mugging days,
l worked St. Mark's Comics.
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:45,815
-Yeah?
-A pipe was my weapon of choice...
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:49,153
...and preteen, comic-book nerds
were my meat.
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,021
So?
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:55,667
There was one kid who had
a sticker on his backpack that said:
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,096
-''Geology rocks!''
-''Geology rocks!''
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,142
-Oh, my God!
-l know! l mugged Ross!
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,150
-You're late.
-l know. l'm sorry.
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,047
But can l just run to the bathroom?
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:18,279
-No. Leonard doesn't wait.
-But l am bursting with Yoo-hoo!
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:22,152
Joey, here we go!
Let's go. Very quickly.
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,727
-l really need--
-We must go now, quickly.
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,990
-Yeah. Yes, sir.
-Ready?
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:32,736
-What the hell are you still doing here?
-l think you know!
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:37,508
-Oh, you sick bastard!
-l am what you made me! Know what?
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:40,406
-What?
-l could go right now.
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:48,451
-Then go. Go!
-Oh, l can't. l want to, but l can't!
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:53,853
Cut. That was good!
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:57,553
-Very good. You did everything l asked.
-l did?
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,325
Yes. Plus which, you've got this,
l don't know, this squirmy quality...
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,462
...you bring to the character
l couldn't have imagined.
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,193
Here's what we're gonna do:
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,897
Come back tomorrow
for the final callbacks.
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:12,202
Do all of this, what you got
going now. But you know what?
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:13,936
More. More. Can you do that?
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:18,447
Sure. l don't have time to say
thank you because l really gotta go!
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,878
Look at that! Still in character.
l like him.
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:28,857
l plant seeds. l can't explain it.
l don't know.
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,863
-Hey. What are you doing?
-Putting on the sneakers...
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:38,730
...to get in the young mindset,
see if it sparks anything.
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,634
-Oh, anything yet?
-Yes, how's this?
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:46,870
''They're so uncomfortable, it's like
getting kicked in the nuts for your feet.''
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:03,086
You're probably wondering
what l'm doing.
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:04,885
No, that seems about right.
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:10,699
Yesterday at my audition, l had to pee.
Apparently, that makes me a good actor.
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:13,895
l got a callback, so l'm drinking
everything. Oh, by the way...
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:16,405
...that eggnog in our fridge was great!
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:21,136
-Joey, that was formula.
-We gotta get more of that.
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:27,449
These aren't half bad. You should
suggest these to Ralph Lauren.
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:32,784
Okay, first of all, that's stupid.
Second, l'm not allowed to talk to Ralph.
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:38,220
All right. l feel younger already.
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:43,457
Yeah, l think l broke my hip.
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,327
-Hey, you!
-Hey.
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:49,063
Hey. How was class?
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,002
No one asks me that. What's wrong?
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:56,204
-Nothing. l really want to know.
-Oh.
00:16:56,382 --> 00:17:00,751
Well, there was actually a rather lively
discussion about the Pleistocene--
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:03,477
All right, nothing is worth this.
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,386
l have a confession to make.
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,585
Okay, you know that girl that
mugged you when you were a kid?
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:16,492
What are you talking about?
lt wasn't a girl. lt was this huge dude.
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:20,866
He had a pitchfork and a sword.
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:25,599
You don't have to lie anymore.
l know that it was a 1 4-year-old girl.
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,335
-No, it wasn't.
-Yes, it was.
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:31,710
You don't think l would have defended
myself against a 1 4-year-old--?
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:35,647
-''Give me your money, punk!''
-Oh, my God, it was you!
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:41,125
l can't believe it. You mugged me?
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,352
Yeah. And l'm so, so sorry, Ross.
l'm sorry.
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:48,295
But, you know, if you think
about it, it's kind of neat.
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:54,132
l mean, well, it's just that l've
always felt kind of like an outsider.
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:57,833
You know, the rest of you have
connections that go way back...
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:02,640
...and, you know, now you
and l have a great one.
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,580
lt's not the best!
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,884
l know. Please forgive me.
l don't know what to say.
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,820
There's nothing you can say! That was
the most humiliating thing ever.
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:17,223
-Even more humiliating than--
-Let's not do this!
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:24,063
And then, at the end of the commercial,
the girls get out of the hot tub...
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,704
...and start making
out with each other.
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:31,275
That's interesting.
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:35,336
Just one thought:
You didn't mention the shoes.
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:40,481
Who's next? Chandler.
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:43,477
You start with a guy
putting on the shoes.
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,681
-He's about my age.
-Your age?
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:51,253
He's rolling down the street
and he starts to lose control.
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,990
Maybe he falls.
Maybe he hurts himself.
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,864
Just then, a kid comes flying
by wearing the shoes.
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:01,631
He jumps over the old guy and laughs.
And the line reads:
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,537
''Not suitable for adults.''
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:09,369
-Well, Chandler, that's great.
-Thank you, sir.
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:13,211
Or, man who's two
years younger than me.
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:18,620
You see, that has a clear selling point.
lt appeals to our key demographic.
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,782
-How did you come up with that?
-l don't know! l don't know!
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:27,660
l was just trying to get into a young
mindset, and stuff started to flow.
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:32,536
-That is great. Good work.
-Thank you.
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:35,400
We'll see all of you tomorrow.
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,186
The cold weather hurts my hip.
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:58,753
Hey, Ross. l know you're still mad at
me, but can l just talk to you for a sec?
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:03,594
Sure, go ahead. Oh, sorry.
Sure, go ahead.
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:06,930
l just really wanted to apologize again.
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:11,940
And also show you something
l think you'll find very exciting.
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:17,581
Oh, my God! ''Crap from the street!''
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,314
Look, Ross. ln this box...
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:29,085
...are all the things l got from mugging
that l thought were too special to sell...
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,196
...or smoke.
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,723
Anyway, l was looking
through it, and l found...
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,198
...<i>Science Boy.</i>
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:42,970
Oh, my God!
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:47,509
l never thought l'd see this again.
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,038
lt's all here!
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,749
What made you save
it all these years?
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:58,422
l guess l just thought
it was really good.
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,990
And maybe it would be
worth something one day.
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:05,319
You really thought <i>Science Boy</i>
was worth saving?
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:10,627
Yeah. But you should know l also have a
jar of Vaseline and a cat skull in here.
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:16,330
Still, this is amazing!
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:18,442
Oh, my God. Thank you, Phoebe.
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:23,080
You're welcome. Thank you for
Science Boy. l learned a lot from him.
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,172
You're welcome.
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,655
Wait a minute.
Did you add something to him?
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:33,188
Oh, yeah.
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:34,916
You see, the way you drew him...
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:38,028
...there was no way
he was ever gonna get Gravity Girl.
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:42,090
He looked like a Ken doll in those tights.
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,761
What's that? What are you...?
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,673
''ls that a beaker
or are you happy to see me?''
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,407
l don't get it.
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:03,345
-l need an answer!
-l can't tell you something l don't know.
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,422
-You know!
-l don't know!
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:11,529
-l need an answer now!
-You want an answer? The answer is....
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:21,839
She never loved me.
She only loved you.
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,736
You knew this all along
and you never told me?
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:30,006
l can never forgive you, or myself. l have
nothing to live for. Bang! And scene!
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,247
Absolutely amazing.
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:40,548
-The part is yours.
-Thanks! Now l really gotta go.
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:44,695
No, wait! Congratulations!
You did it.
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:48,026
You did it. You can relax now. Yeah.
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,738
Wow! That's a big cable bill.
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:08,943
You don't have a job,
but you have no problem ordering porn.
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:12,079
On a Saturday afternoon?
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:14,790
l was in the house!
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:20,225
Hey. Phoebe didn't by any
chance mention that--
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:22,900
She was the huge guy that
mugged you? Yeah.
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:26,593
l see. You didn't happen to tell--
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:30,036
-Everybody we know? Yeah.
-Great. Thanks.
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,700
