00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,308
Joey?
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,903
Oh, my God.
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,576
Okay.
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:27,687
So...
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:32,562
...l guess we should
make it official, huh?
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,335
Look, Rach, l....
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:40,967
Hey, Ross is here!
Hey, look, it's my good friend Ross!
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:44,041
-Hey, Ross.
-Hey, Joey.
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:47,169
-Hey, you.
-Hey, you.
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:52,841
And he brought flowers! Thanks, Ross.
l'm really more of a candy kind of guy.
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:55,913
You're weird today.
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:01,682
Listen, l wanted to talk to you
about something.
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:05,592
Yeah. Actually, l kind of need
to talk to you too.
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,597
-Joey, could you give us a minute?
-No.
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,568
-What?
-l'm sorry. l meant, ''No.''
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,875
Hi. Hey, look who's here.
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:21,042
Where's my granddaughter?
l've been practicing my magic tricks.
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:24,045
He pulled a quarter out of my ear.
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:27,612
-Hey, where's Mom?
-She went to pick up Aunt Liddy.
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:30,516
Aunt Liddy's coming?
That means we get $5 each!
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:37,457
So when do l get to meet Emma
and show her this:
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,027
Okay, wow.
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:44,128
Emma's in the nursery.
l'll take you now if you want.
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:47,831
-But l really want to talk to you.
-l know. l still need to talk to you.
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,407
But before you guys do that,
l need to talk to you.
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:53,510
And Ross, l need to talk to you.
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:56,045
-And l need to talk to you.
-About what?
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,911
To see if you know
what these guys are talking about.
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,894
lsn't she beautiful?
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:52,702
Look at her, my first grandchild.
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,674
What about Ben?
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:02,441
Well, of course, Ben.
l meant my first granddaughter.
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,589
God, isn't she beautiful?
Doesn't she look just like Rachel?
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:15,888
l know everybody keeps saying that,
but all l see is Vin Diesel.
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,032
What do you think
our baby will look like?
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,499
Oh, God. Please. You.
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,904
But it'll have my sense of humor.
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:36,882
Have you thought any more
about you and Rachel?
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,383
Yeah, actually l was gonna talk to her
when you guys came in the room.
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:44,887
That's so exciting! Wow.
You could've done that with us there.
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,055
-Yeah, right.
-Sure. Okay.
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,561
You can touch yourself in front of us,
but you can't talk to Rachel.
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:55,223
What? When have l ever
touched myself in front of you guys?
00:03:55,401 --> 00:04:00,964
Oh, please. Just before,
when you were asleep in the lounge.
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:04,234
That Armenian family was watching you
instead of the TV.
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:11,213
That reminds me. That Mr. Hazmegian
still has my Game Boy.
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:14,045
-Chandler, can l talk to you for a second?
-Sure.
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,452
Dude, l just did something terrible.
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,324
That was you? l thought it was Jack.
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:26,327
No, no. That was Jack.
Rachel thinks l asked her to marry me.
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:31,196
-What? Why does she think that?
-Because it kind of looked like l did.
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,404
Again, what?
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:36,806
Okay, l was down on one knee
with the ring in my hand--
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,501
As we all are at some point
during the day.
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,312
lt wasn't my ring.
lt fell out of Ross' jacket...
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,611
...and when l knelt down to pick it up,
Rachel thought l was proposing.
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:48,912
Ross had a ring?
And he was gonna propose?
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,250
-l guess.
-And you did it first?
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:55,622
This is gonna kill him. You know
how much he loves to propose.
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,454
l know. l know. lt's awful.
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,031
Well, what did she say?
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,929
She said, ''Yes.''
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,662
You're smiling.
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,602
No, l'm not.
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:12,344
Yes, you are. l can tell
by the way your mouth is.
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,838
Does Ross know?
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:18,984
Oh, my God.
What the hell am l gonna tell him?
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,676
-Maybe you don't have to tell him.
-l like that. Yeah.
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,485
lf you clear things up with Rachel,
Ross never needs to find out.
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,559
But you have to do it before
he hears about it and kicks your ass.
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:31,958
All right, let's not get carried away.
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,890
l want a baby.
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:39,232
Honey, we've been over this.
l need to be facing the other way.
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,872
lf we have sex again, it'll double
our chances of getting pregnant.
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:48,980
-l think that closet's still available.
-l am so tired.
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,516
-Yeah, okay, but no foreplay.
-Deal!
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,719
Dad, seriously!
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:08,091
You know, you really should
see someone about that.
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:10,167
Noted.
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:15,197
l wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute.
Are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:19,744
Are you kidding me?
l could stay and look at her forever.
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:24,174
Actually....
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,048
-Hey.
-Hi.
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,555
Are you all right?
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:38,994
-l think l just got engaged.
-Oh, my God! He did it?
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:41,291
What? Did you know
he was gonna ask me?
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:45,870
Are you kidding?
l'm, like, the one who talked him into it.
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:49,804
l like to think of myself
as the puppet master of the group.
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:54,875
-And you really think this is a good idea?
-l just talked him into it.
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:57,777
Don't tell me l have to do you too?
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:01,613
-The puppet master gets tired, people.
-Okay.
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:04,517
l don't know. lt just doesn't feel right.
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:08,319
Why? You two are so meant
to be together. Everybody thinks so.
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,962
Really? Even Ross?
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:15,100
Especially Ross.
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:21,633
Hey, Pheebs. You know what?
l'll come back later.
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:26,539
Wow. Kind of a full house here.
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,572
l guess l'll just-- l'll come back.
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:37,084
There he goes. Your fiancé.
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,552
l guess so.
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,255
Although he does
play with himself in his sleep.
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,489
l can't say l'm surprised.
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:53,471
-Dad, what are you doing?
-There are people in there having sex.
00:07:56,676 --> 00:08:00,009
lt can't be me. l'm standing right here.
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,280
-Wanna peek?
-No!
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:03,506
Come on.
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:07,552
You know what?
l don't like you without Mom.
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:09,778
Come on.
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:13,323
We're not peeking?
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,226
Well, l'm peeking.
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:20,930
Oh, my God!
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:25,328
Hello, sir. You know Monica.
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,316
-Hey, is it okay to come in?
-Of course.
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:47,458
Joey, this ring, l--
lt's beautiful. l love it.
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:53,198
Yeah. Look, Rach,
there's something l gotta tell you.
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,458
-Hey.
-Hi.
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:58,866
-Are you ready to try nursing again?
-Yeah. Hi, Emma.
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,039
Why do you think
she won't take my breast?
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,607
lt's all right.
lt takes babies a while to get it.
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:06,438
-But don't worry, it'll happen.
-Okay.
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:14,084
Okay, sweetie, you can do it.
Just open up and put it in your mouth.
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,384
Dear Lord.
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:22,726
-l'm sorry, honey, what were you saying?
-Yeah, look, l think that--
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,830
Because, look! She's pulling away again.
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:29,695
Do you think my nipples
are too big for her mouth?
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,099
She looks scared.
Doesn't she look scared?
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:38,539
You know, l don't really know her.
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:41,677
Why don't we try massaging
the breast to stimulate the flow?
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:45,317
-Okay.
-Are you kidding me?
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:49,218
This is so frustrating.
Why doesn't she want my breast?
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,823
l don't know! Maybe she's crazy!
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:57,356
-Hey, wait up.
-Hi.
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,259
Congratulations.
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,663
l didn't want to say anything in front
of Joey. l didn't know if he knew.
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:06,360
What? That we had a baby?
Now let's give him a little credit.
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,997
Although he did eat a piece
of plastic fruit earlier.
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,838
No, no, that you
and Rachel are engaged.
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,714
-What?
-Oh, it's a secret?
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:21,148
Goody. Yes! We haven't done
the secret thing in a long time.
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:25,087
No, Rachel and l are not engaged.
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:27,748
l think you are.
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,729
What are you talking about?
Who told you that?
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:33,490
Rachel, your betrothed.
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:38,894
-We're not engaged.
-Oh, that's right. lt's a secret.
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:43,098
Right, you are not engaged.
l misunderstood her.
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:48,441
Phoebe, there is no secret, okay?
l didn't propose.
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:49,706
Are you lying?
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:54,318
ls this like that time you tried
to convince us you were a doctor?
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,424
l am a doctor!
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,153
You know what? l'm just gonna go
and talk to Rachel myself.
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,925
All right. Well, me too.
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:13,136
-Well, should we wake her up?
-No. No. Come on, let her sleep.
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:17,742
-She's so exhausted.
-And so engaged.
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:32,385
Oh, my God. She thinks we're engaged!
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:36,361
Why? Why, why would
she think we're engaged?
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,623
Perhaps because you gave her
an engagement ring?
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,495
You know, Ross,
doctors are supposed to be smart.
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,197
-l didn't give her that ring.
-You didn't?
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,670
-No!
-So whose ring is it?
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,143
lt's mine.
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,146
-ls it an engagement ring?
-Yes.
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,143
-But you didn't give it to her?
-No.
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,373
-But you were going to propose?
-No!
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:02,348
l might be losing interest in this.
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:06,222
Look. Look, my mom
gave me that ring...
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,417
...because she wanted me
to propose to Rachel.
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,824
But all l wanted to do was see...
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:14,830
...if she maybe, kind of wanted
to start things up again.
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,592
What beautiful lukewarm sentiment.
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:22,038
l didn't want to rush into anything.
lt seemed like she didn't want to either.
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,200
But l don't understand
how any of this happened.
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:29,313
What, did she find the ring in my jacket,
assume l was gonna propose...
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:32,883
...throw it on
and just start telling people?
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,986
No, no. She said you
actually proposed to her.
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:41,353
Well, l didn't! l didn't propose!
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:43,725
Unless....
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:47,395
Did l?
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:56,173
l haven't slept in 40 hours and....
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:02,574
lt does sound
like something l would do.
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,588
Look, we can't stay in here forever.
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:15,093
lt's just, l still can't believe
that my dad saw us having sex.
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:19,526
He didn't make it to one
of my piano recitals, but this he sees!
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,867
This is okay. We're all adults here.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:27,733
Now, let's put our underwear
in our pockets and walk out the door.
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,106
Hi, Dad.
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:41,882
-l can still call you that, right?
-Of course. l'll always be your dad.
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:47,048
l just want you to know that what you
witnessed in there, that wasn't for fun.
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:52,392
-lt wasn't fun?
-Why, why, why would you...?
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:55,492
Look, l just don't want you to think...
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,330
...that we're animals who do it
whenever we want.
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,198
Well, l don't think that.
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:04,206
Before today, l never thought
of you two having sex at all.
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:07,004
lt was a simpler time.
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:10,643
The truth is, Dad, we're trying.
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,875
To kill you.
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,782
Why, why, why would you...?
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:19,791
We're trying to have a baby.
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,257
-What?
-Yeah, we're trying to get pregnant.
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,620
Oh, my God, this is so exciting.
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,230
Well, get back in there!
l'll guard the door!
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,300
That's okay, Dad,
we can wait until later.
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,596
Whoa! l don't think so.
Aren't you ovulating?
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,038
Daddy!
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,799
You gotta get at it, princess.
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,103
When your mother and l
were trying to conceive you...
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,872
...whenever she was ovulating,
bam, we did it!
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,571
That's how l got my bad hip.
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:48,780
That's funny. This conversation's how
l got the bullet hole in my head.
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:52,583
This one time l had my knee
on the sink, and your mother was--
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:55,386
Seriously, sir, my brains,
all over the wall.
00:14:57,263 --> 00:15:00,858
l don't think we need to hear
the specific positions you and Mom had.
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,627
You're right.
This is about your positions.
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:07,431
Now, what l saw in the closet
is not the optimum position...
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,733
...for conceiving a child.
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,640
-Although it might feel good.
-l don't feel good right now.
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:17,747
But pleasure is important,
and it helps if the woman has an orgasm.
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,251
You up to the task, sailor?
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,987
Oh, my God....
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:38,065
-Hey.
-Hey. Oh, l need to tell you something.
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:43,037
Well, now's a good time.
l'm on my way to have my ears cut off.
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,303
Joey asked me to marry him.
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,509
-What?
-Joey proposed to me.
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:52,115
-ls he crazy? You just had Ross' baby!
-Well, l said yes.
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:55,082
What, are you crazy?
You just had Ross' baby!
00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:00,556
l'm sensing you won't throw the shower?
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:04,526
lt's so inappropriate.
No, it is worse than that. lt is wrong.
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,430
lt is bigger than mine!
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,961
l know. <i>Days of our Lives,</i>
thank you very much.
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,537
-You can't marry him.
-Why not?
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:18,199
Come on, l don't want to do this alone,
and he's such a sweet guy.
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:19,867
And he loves me so much.
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,307
Well, do you love him?
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,907
Sure.
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:29,779
-Sure?
-Yeah, l mean, whatever.
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:33,989
lf you're worried about breaking his heart,
it's still broken from the last time.
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,322
So really, you're just taking
the already broken pieces...
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:41,227
...and breaking them into smaller,
more manageable pieces.
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,097
Okay, forget that.
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,999
Honey, the question is...
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,867
...do you really want to marry Joey?
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:52,505
No.
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,511
No, l don't.
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:01,549
Could you be a dear and go tell him?
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:04,319
You still haven't told Rachel
you weren't proposing?
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,856
No. She had the ring on...
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:10,085
...she seemed so excited,
and then she took her breast out.
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:15,495
Joey, you have to tell her what's
going on. And what did it look like?
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:18,101
l didn't look at it.
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,601
The stupid baby's head
was blocking most of it.
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,337
Go and tell Rachel right now,
before Ross finds out.
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,946
Look, it's not that easy.
She said she wanted to marry me.
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:30,741
l don't want to hurt her.
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:33,448
Okay, look, just do it gently.
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,844
You're right.
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:40,014
You're right. l'll go tell her now
before Ross finds out, and l'll be gentle.
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:44,424
l can do that. l am a gentle person.
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:48,965
By the way, two people screwing
in there if you want to check that out.
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,868
Hey.
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,773
Hey.
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,117
Listen, l heard about the engagement.
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:09,886
Surprised?
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,854
And confused.
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:20,094
Rach, sweetie...
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,858
...l didn't propose to you.
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,601
l know.
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:30,671
l don't think you do.
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,573
You didn't propose to me.
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:38,307
Joey did.
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:42,020
Poor baby, you're so tired.
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:48,254
Rach, l didn't propose to you.
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:51,396
Joey didn't propose to you.
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:56,660
And Chandler didn't propose to you.
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,970
You didn't propose to me.
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,234
Chandler didn't propose to me.
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:06,172
But Joey did.
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:09,340
Joey proposed to you?
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:12,882
-l can come back.
-Wait. Wait. Wait.
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:16,577
-Joey, did you propose to her?
-No.
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:21,187
-Yes, you did.
-Actually, technically, l didn't.
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:24,862
-Well, then, why did you give me a ring?
-Wait.
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:31,458
-You gave her the ring?
-No, and l did not ask her to marry me.
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,035
-Yes, you did.
-No, l didn't.
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:34,433
-Yes, you did.
-No, l didn't.
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,541
Yes, you did, and don't
you say you didn't!
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:40,644
He was right there. He got down
on one knee and he proposed.
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:43,178
-You were down on one knee?
-Yeah, that looks bad.
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:47,910
But l didn't propose.
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,816
-Then what did happen?
-Yeah, what did happen?
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:54,117
Okay, the ring fell on the floor,
and l went down to pick it up...
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:57,660
...and you thought l was proposing.
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:01,959
Yeah, but you said,
''Will you marry me?''
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,032
-No, l didn't.
-Yes, you did.
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:07,569
-No, l didn't.
-Yes, you did. Oh, my God, you didn't.
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:16,405
-Why didn't you tell me that before?
-Well, l tried...
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:21,019
...but people kept coming in,
and then you took your breast out.
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:26,080
You saw her breast?
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:30,388
l'll tell you about it later. Be cool.
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,532
Then what the hell were you doing
with an engagement ring?
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,327
lt wasn't my ring! lt's Ross' ring.
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:42,166
That's why l felt so bad, Rach,
because he was gonna propose.
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,739
What?!
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:46,906
You were gonna propose to me?
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:53,783
No.
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,758
Well, this is awkward.
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:13,735
But l was going to see if, you know,
maybe you wanted to start dating again.
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:19,775
-But that, l mean, that was all, Rach.
-Dude, step up. l proposed.
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,742
No, you didn't.
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:27,442
That's right. There's a lot going on here,
and l think l ate some bad fruit earlier.
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:32,149
All right, so let me just get this clear.
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:34,758
You didn't propose.
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:37,224
You weren't gonna propose.
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,863
So this morning,
l didn't have a boyfriend...
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:44,628
...and somehow l got dumped
twice today.
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:52,304
Hey, she just woke up. She's hungry.
Why don't we give this another try?
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:55,645
Here we go again.
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:59,016
l can't believe you told her
l was gonna propose.
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:02,984
-l can't believe you're not gonna.
-Hey, l am not gonna rush into anything.
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,213
Yeah, dude, l totally understand.
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,848
Usually after l have a baby with
a woman, l like to slow things down!
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:11,627
-Oh, my God!
-What?
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:13,558
She's doing it!
She's breast-feeding!
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:17,099
lt's beautiful.
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:19,793
-l'll come back for her later.
-Thank you.
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:26,410
-Wow, this feels weird.
-What, good weird?
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,636
Wonderful weird.
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:32,815
You know what, you guys?
l'm gonna go too.
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:37,250
And l'm sorry about everything.
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:41,290
-Honey, don't worry, it was my mistake.
-No, Rach, l should've told you sooner.
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,155
lt's just that....
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:45,228
Man, that kid is going to town!
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:02,339
She's perfect.
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,777
We're so lucky.
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:07,110
We really are.
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:16,622
Look, l know it's not a proposal,
and l don't know where you are...
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:20,697
...but with everything that's been
going on and with Emma, l'm....
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:24,802
-l've been feeling....
-Yeah, l know.
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,835
l've been feeling....
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:28,836
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:33,811
Okay, well, that--
Wow, okay, well--
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:37,642
Then maybe at least we can
talk about us again?
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,976
Yeah. Maybe.
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:44,315
Well, good. Okay.
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:48,289
l kind of think, you know, if we, if--
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:54,327
You're wearing the ring.
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,096
What's that?
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:07,133
And you told Phoebe
you were engaged.
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:12,249
l'm sorry, what?
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:18,752
When you thought Joey proposed...
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:20,718
...did you say yes?
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:37,700
Kids, l spoke to a doctor and picked up
these pamphlets on how to get pregnant.
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:41,473
-Hey, Dad.
-Hi.
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:51,081
Sorry to bother you again,
but could you pass my pamphlets back?
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,888
Thank you.
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,319
