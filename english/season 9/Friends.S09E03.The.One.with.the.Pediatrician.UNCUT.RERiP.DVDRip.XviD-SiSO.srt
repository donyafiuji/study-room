00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:07,906
So, what's the big news you had us
rush all the way over here for?
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:09,871
lt took you 45 minutes
to cross a street.
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:12,773
Come on, guys. lt's just one baby.
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:17,679
Oh, sure, now you guys clam up.
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:23,213
Our news. My company has asked me
to head up our office in Tulsa.
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,824
So as of Monday,
l'm being officially relocated.
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:27,687
-Oh, my God!
-What? Monday?
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:31,262
-How long do you have to go for?
-They said it could be up to a year.
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:33,797
-A year?
-Well, do you have to go?
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:38,429
Well, l kind of have to, don't l?
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:41,540
Because of this stupid thing.
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:48,013
There's nothing like the support
of your loving wife, huh?
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,513
Wait a minute.
Wait, you can't go to Tulsa.
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:54,619
Maybe you forgot, but we have tickets
to the Jets game next week!
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:57,551
l'm sorry, but l don't think
l'll be able to make it.
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:00,925
But we were gonna go see the Jets!
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:07,094
You can't go. l mean, you're the glue
that holds this group together.
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,035
-Really?
-Not you.
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,671
This whole thing is gonna be okay.
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:19,539
They said they'd rent us a house in
the suburbs. You guys can come and visit.
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:22,272
Oh, God, that is so not gonna happen.
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:26,948
l can't believe you guys are moving.
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:31,919
-l call their apartment!
-No!
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:22,136
-Here you go, Rach.
-Thank you, Joey.
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:25,766
You know what?
l'm not even sure l can have caffeine.
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:29,972
l went through this with Ben and Carol.
One coffee won't affect your milk.
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:34,119
Just to be sure,
l'm gonna call Dr. Wiener.
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,190
Every time?
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,957
You don't have to call him
whenever you have a question, okay?
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,931
-Trust me. l know this.
-All right. l trust you.
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,835
l can see you dialing.
l don't understand why--
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,566
l'm on the phone! Dr. Wiener?
00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:01,237
lt's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel
with a baby. lt's just so grownup.
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:05,748
l know, yeah.
l feel like we're all growing up.
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,615
A person named ''Wiener.''
God, that kills me.
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:13,787
-Look at you all grownup.
-Well, actually, you know what?
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,750
l am, you know?
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,796
Well, that whole thing
with Rachel made me realize...
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:22,628
...that maybe l'm ready for a more
serious relationship, you know?
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:26,329
Like, l'd like to meet a nice,
mature, commitment-minded lady.
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:29,600
And looks aren't as important as....
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,534
Nah, she's gotta be hot.
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,537
You know, l might know somebody.
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:37,511
How about you set me up
with someone, and we double-date?
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,982
l can do that. Yeah.
How's Friday?
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,177
-Done!
-All right.
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:43,515
Good, really?
Okay, let's see.
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,782
All right.
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,788
You know who's great?
Sandy Poopack.
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:53,261
''Poopack''?
00:03:55,969 --> 00:04:00,269
Yeah. All right.
Well, that rules out Lana Titwyler.
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:08,872
-l've got good news.
-You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:11,539
Okay, l have news.
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:15,614
You don't have to move to Tulsa.
You can stay here and keep your job.
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:17,153
That's great! How?
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:20,815
My boss and l worked out a deal
where l'm in Tulsa four days a week.
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,121
So the other three,
l can be here with you.
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,963
So you're gonna be gone
four days a week?
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:28,991
No.
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:32,467
l'm sorry, are you just
used to saying that?
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:37,933
No. l can't be away
from you for that long.
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,344
-Really?
-Yeah, you're my husband.
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:44,813
l won't live in a different state
than you for 20<i>8</i> days out of the year.
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:50,087
That's fast math.
We could use you in Tulsa.
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:56,961
Thanks for trying to figure out a way,
but if you go to Tulsa, l go with you.
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:59,388
You said that without gagging.
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,365
l know!
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,700
Well, excuse me?
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:10,741
Oh, yeah?
Well, up yours too!
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,841
-Who the hell was that?
-Dr. Wiener.
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:20,385
Rach, you can't call people
at 3:00 in the morning.
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:23,784
You know what?
You sound just like his wife.
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:26,282
Was there anything
even wrong with Emma?
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:30,555
Yes, of course there is!
Okay? l'm not insane.
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,290
What was it?
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,125
Hiccups.
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:39,499
l told you, you can't call him
every time any little thing comes up.
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:43,765
Well, not anymore l can't.
He fired us!
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:45,976
Can you believe that?
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:50,309
l could believe it if he came here and hit you
over the head with a copy of <i>Highlights</i>.
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:53,577
What are we gonna do?
We have to find a pediatrician.
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,381
Wait, Monica said that
when you guys were growing up...
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,820
...you liked your doctor.
What was his name?
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:01,149
Dr. Gettleman?
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:04,056
Yeah, no, l don't think
that's a good idea.
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,562
ln fact, l think he's dead.
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,792
Why does everything happen to me?
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:13,297
l promise, first thing tomorrow,
we'll find another doctor.
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:15,998
But l gotta get up early,
and l'm not feeling well.
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:19,110
You're not feeling well?
What do you have? Rubella?
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:22,441
Because don't go near Emma,
she has not had that shot.
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:26,583
You know, come to think of it,
it does feel rubella-like.
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,292
Wiener!
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,490
Wiener! Wiener! Wiener!
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:42,725
Rachel!
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:46,100
Great! Now he's gonna
know it was me!
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,809
And the kung pao chicken.
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,141
Utensils and plates for one.
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:58,806
And can you read the order back to me?
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:10,853
Great.
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:13,831
Yeah. Okay, thanks. Bye.
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:20,968
So how is this
for our big double date tonight?
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:23,538
Oh, my God.
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:28,244
Great. Just the reaction
l was hoping for.
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:32,077
Yeah, so you found someone for me?
You didn't forget?
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:34,719
Of course not.
And you'll love Mary Ellen.
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:38,448
She's really smart and cute
and funny and....
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:43,960
l can't tell you how l know this,
but she is not opposed to threesomes.
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,223
All right.
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:51,066
-So tell me something about my guy.
-No.
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:55,599
Come on, give me something.
What's his name?
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,909
l'm not sure l understand the question.
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:04,549
What do they call him?
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:08,478
-Mike.
-Mike. Okay, what's his last name?
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:12,954
Damn it! ls there no mystery left
in romance anymore?!
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:16,322
We'll see you and Mike
at the restaurant in a couple hours.
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:20,455
All right, great.
See you. Bye-bye.
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:25,332
Why'd l have to say Mike? l don't know
a Mike! Why couldn't l have said...?
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,334
There's no guys in there!
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:36,108
So this is being a parent, huh?
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:39,508
l think l can handle this.
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,676
Too intense. Too intense.
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,118
Well, l did it.
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:50,057
l told my crew at the restaurant
l'm heading off to Tulsa.
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:53,858
-Oh, yeah? How'd they take it.
-Pretty well. Yeah.
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,467
They were brave little soldiers.
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,671
Did their best to be stoic.
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,808
Some of them even high-fived each other
to mask their pain.
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:09,576
lt's impossible to find a good doctor.
How do you know the good ones...
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:13,344
...from the ones who'll push
their penis against your knee?
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:15,812
Excuse me?
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:18,218
l know what she's talking about.
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:24,423
You probably also had the piano teacher
with the wandering hands.
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:31,568
Well, we've gotta find
a new pediatrician.
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,763
Ross was getting sick last night,
and Emma may have caught it.
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,875
-Why don't you see Dr. Gettleman?
-Ross said he died.
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:41,104
He didn't die.
l just saw his daughter last week.
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:46,718
She said he was fine.
Her, on the other hand, botched Botox.
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,580
Great. Well then, l'm gonna
take Emma to see him.
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,552
l wonder why Ross said that he died?
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:54,591
Maybe he confused him
with his childhood therapist.
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,886
He saw a therapist?
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:59,031
He used to have a recurring nightmare.
lt freaked him out.
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:01,257
Wow, what was it?
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,129
That l was going to eat him.
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,441
Mike!
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,516
Yeah?
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,282
Okay.
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,494
l can't believe
l'm doing this with you.
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,134
Although l did just end
a nine-year relationship...
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,566
...so l should be open
to taking some risks.
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,866
That's good.
Get all that boring stuff out now.
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:45,138
Everything is gonna be fine.
Follow my lead, okay?
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,302
All you have to do is
pretend to be Mike.
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,471
-l am Mike.
-Attaboy.
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:54,108
Here they come.
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,481
-l'm Phoebe.
-Phoebe. Mike. How you doing?
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,648
-Nice to meet you.
-Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins.
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:03,283
So, Mike, how do you and Joey
know each other, anyway?
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,966
How do Joey and l know each other?
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:13,265
lf l had a nickel for every time
somebody's asked me that.
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,406
-From school.
-We met in college.
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:21,602
l mean high school.
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:27,148
You guys go way back, then.
So, what are you up to these days?
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:31,517
-Well, l'm a lawyer.
-Mike, attorney at law!
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:34,315
-Actually, l just gave up my practice.
-What?
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:38,486
That's the kind of thing
you usually run by me.
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:43,332
l want to play piano professionally.
lf l don't do this now, l never will.
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,902
Great. l like that better
than the lawyer thing.
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:50,008
Which is why l waited until now
to introduce you to Mike.
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:52,167
You thought he was still a lawyer.
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:55,541
No, that's not what l meant.
Let's get you a cocktail.
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:01,312
What are you doing?
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:04,149
Looking for restaurant jobs
for you in Tulsa.
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,382
That's so sweet.
Did you find anything?
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,255
-Slim Pickins.
-Nothing, huh?
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:13,421
No. Slim Pickins.
lt's a barbecue joint.
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:17,262
They're looking for a cook. Actually,
''cook'' may be a bit of a stretch.
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,995
They're looking for somebody
to shovel mesquite.
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,874
''Slim Pickins''? That is so cheesy.
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,876
Well, So Cheesy also has an opening.
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,877
Honey, that's okay.
l know this woman, Nancy...
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:33,041
...who's a restaurant biz headhunter.
She may know something.
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,881
Can l say how much l appreciate
you coming with me?
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:40,992
When we get to Tulsa, l am taking you
for a great dinner at Slim Pickins.
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,584
So Cheesy?
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,795
Whole Hog?
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,366
lt's gonna be tough
to keep kosher in Tulsa.
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,308
Hi, Nancy?
Hi, it's Monica Geller.
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:04,006
l'm good. Listen, l'm looking
for a job in Tulsa.
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,910
Yeah, well, my husband's
been relocated.
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,612
Because l love him.
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:13,456
No, l don't want a job in New York.
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,823
Javu's looking? Oh, my God!
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:20,988
He asked for me personally?
Oh, my God!
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:24,625
Wow, this is really,
really flattering.
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,637
But l'm moving to Tulsa.
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,435
So, just, if you would tell Javu...
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:32,975
...l'll take it!
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:37,345
My name's Rachel Greene.
l have an appointment for Emma.
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:41,486
Dr. Gettleman is finishing up
with a patient. He'll be out shortly.
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:45,283
l think you just have a cold.
lt's definitely not strep.
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:46,788
Thanks, doctor.
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:53,860
-Would you like a lollipop?
-Do you even have to ask?
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,965
He is alive!
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:09,111
lt's so surprising that you and Joey
have known each other for so long...
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:10,942
...and l've never heard about you.
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:15,485
That's because we had
a bit of a falling out.
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:18,646
Mike hit my mom with a car.
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:25,085
-No, l didn't.
-That's okay. l have forgiven you.
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,528
Now we're friends again,
and everything's great.
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:29,462
Well, wait. ls your mom okay?
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:33,503
Please, we're trying
to have a conversation.
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:36,868
You're a lot nicer
on <i>Days of Our Lives.</i>
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,636
That's why you look so familiar!
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:40,904
-What?
-What?
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,207
What?
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:46,512
Do you not know each other?
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:53,314
Of course we do. He's playing a game
we used to play in high school.
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:56,825
We pretend we don't know each other.
We played all kinds of games.
00:14:56,996 --> 00:15:01,433
You remember that one where l punch
you in the face for not being cool?
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:06,801
Let me ask you something:
How many sisters does Joey have?
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:09,873
-Six.
-No, he doesn't. He has seven.
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,510
What are you doing? l said seven!
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:19,079
Joey, why did you set me up
with a stranger?
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:23,244
Because l forgot about our date.
l'm so sorry.
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:27,825
l'm sorry too. And just to be clear,
l didn't hit his mother with a car.
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,185
Although l'd like to be
hit by one right now.
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:31,727
Yeah, no problem.
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:38,098
You are unbelievable. l spent so much
time finding the perfect girl for you.
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:41,296
Mary Ellen is really smart
and cute and loose.
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:46,170
Who are you kidding?
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,509
You find some guy
off the street for me?
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,745
God, this is humiliating!
00:15:55,921 --> 00:16:00,017
l'm so sorry. lf you don't like this guy,
l can find you a better one.
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:02,956
Mike? Mike?
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,157
l'm out of here.
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,496
lt was nice meeting you.
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,999
-You're leaving too?
-l'll stay if you can tell me my name.
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,398
Have a good night.
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,475
We leave tomorrow,
and you still have a lot to pack.
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,805
You're right.
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,477
Maybe l shouldn't go.
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,641
What?
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:31,512
So Nancy told me about this job
at this great restaurant, Javu?
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,954
But it's just
a little outside of Tulsa.
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,457
Well, how far outside?
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,818
Manhattan?
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:43,025
And you're thinking of taking it?
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:48,364
Before, you said that being with me
was more important than any job.
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:53,477
But l guess now it's
old job, me, new job.
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:56,974
l'm gonna miss this hand!
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,713
l know this is a lot to ask...
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:03,912
...but, my God, this is
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:07,081
What happened to ''you can't live
without me four days a week''?
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:12,356
Well, if you really think about it,
l mean, four days is not that long.
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,396
l see you Monday
before you go to work...
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:16,261
...and Thursday when you get back...
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:20,199
...and l always work late on Tuesdays,
so really if you think about it...
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,771
...it's really just one day.
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:26,968
And well, if we can't make it one day,
we got real problems, my friend.
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,246
-l think you should take the job.
-Really?
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:38,516
l know it must be important to you
when you start chattering like a monkey.
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,592
That's the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me.
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:45,992
lt's your dream job.
l can't make you pass it up.
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,928
Besides, l'm proud of you.
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,624
-You are?
-Yeah.
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,703
And when l get to Tulsa and
people say, ''Where's the missus'' ...
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:55,169
...l'll tell them she's a chef at Javu.
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:58,705
And then, when they stare
at me blankly...
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:03,109
...l'll make some offensive Tulsa joke,
and thus, begin my isolation.
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,846
-How was the pediatrician?
-l really liked him.
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:15,687
Yeah, yeah.
lt was really, really, really good.
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:19,486
-You promised not to say anything.
-l know.
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:22,896
Ross still sees his pediatrician!
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,698
l don't care.
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,871
Are you serious?
You still see Dr. Gettleman?
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:33,011
He is a brilliant diagnostician!
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:36,909
Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,108
Seriously, you gotta go
to an appropriate doctor.
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,152
And not an orthodontist...
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:46,382
...not a gynecologist...
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,425
...and not a veterinarian....
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:53,792
Why? l know it's a little weird,
but he is a great doctor, okay?
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,695
He knows my medical history.
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:58,768
And every time l go in there,
he makes a big deal.
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:01,462
You know,
''Look, it's my favorite patient.''
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,303
Does he say that before he sticks
his thermometer in your tushy?
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:10,141
l seem to remember someone bringing
his security blanket to college.
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,216
That was not a security blanket.
That was a wall hanging.
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,477
lt didn't spend much time on the wall!
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,496
Excuse me.
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,691
Hi. l was hoping to run into you.
Can we talk?
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,298
Sure.
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:36,100
Yeah. There's someone
l want you to meet.
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:39,438
This is my best friend from high school.
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,273
l'm sorry, l don't think l know you.
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:45,075
How hard was that?
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:49,714
Look, l'm sorry, really.
l'm so embarrassed.
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,081
Please.
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:58,353
Really, l'm a pretty nice guy.
Just ask my parole officer.
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,736
Apparently, l'm not a funny guy.
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:09,470
Well, why did you go along with that?
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:14,874
Because l was told that l'd get
a free dinner, which l didn't.
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,278
And that l'd meet a pretty girl,
which l did.
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:22,779
That's true.
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,485
Well, is anything you told me
about yourself true?
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,652
My name is Mike.
And l do play piano.
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,596
-Prove it.
-There isn't a piano here.
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:39,362
That wouldn't stand in the way
of a true pianist.
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:41,504
Okay.
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:59,548
You are really good.
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:07,398
-l play a little guitar myself.
-Really? That's great.
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:11,229
-What kind of music do you play?
-Like acoustic, folksy stuff, you know?
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:16,272
But right now l'm working on
a couple lron Maiden covers.
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:23,475
Do you think that, maybe,
sometime, l could....
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:26,083
lt's okay. Go ahead, ask me out.
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:31,217
Okay. You think, maybe,
sometime l could take you out?
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,085
You just caught me off guard.
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,024
Yeah, that would be nice.
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,857
Look at this! My two best friends!
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:50,204
Excuse me.
l don't mean to be a jerk...
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,902
...but the baby with the rash
came in after me.
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:57,544
-The doctor will be right with you, sir.
-l hear you...
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,843
...but do you have any harder puzzles?
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:07,783
Mommy, l can't find Waldo.
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,483
What page are you on?
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,095
What, the circus?
He's behind the elephant.
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:15,995
Wow. So your child's a big fan
of the Waldo books too?
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,396
Yeah, that's how l know.
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:25,099
-l'm Ross, by the way.
-Hi, l'm Sally.
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:29,077
So no ring. Can l assume
you're also a single parent?
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:33,013
-l am a single parent.
-lt's hard, isn't it?
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,677
There's no time for a social life.
Where are you gonna meet someone?
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,447
-Well....
-Mommy, l can't--
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:40,784
Sea shore? Row boat.
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:49,459
Let's say, l don't know, you met
someone in the pediatrician's office.
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:53,102
Rossie? We're ready for you.
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:03,003
Yeah....
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:09,110
Come on, Ross Jr.
lt's time to go in.
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:12,446
Mommy.
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,488
Mommy, what's wrong with that man?
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:21,029
Hey, l helped you find Waldo!
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:31,735
-Good, you haven't left yet.
-Where have you been?
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:35,311
l got held up
at Dr. Gettleman's office.
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:40,213
There was some guy
that freaked everybody out.
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,411
l don't think l'm going back there.
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:46,318
You got here just in time.
l really have to go, buddy.
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:47,515
Oh, man.
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:51,526
-Promise to call me when you land?
-Of course l will. l love you.
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:52,856
l love you too.
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:01,905
Watch the tongue, people.
We got a baby over here.
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:05,240
-Bye, Chandler.
-Bye.
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,776
-Bye, honey.
-Bye.
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:16,018
-What's the matter, Joe?
-l'm mad at you for leaving.
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:19,988
You know, you're nothing
but a big leaver.
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:23,693
A big leaver with a stupid suitcase.
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:30,398
Any chance you're trying to pick
a fight to make all of this easier?
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:36,402
Dude, you see right through me!
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,717
Okay, well.... Bye, Mon.
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:50,411
Bye, Ross. Rachel.
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:54,185
-Bye, Emma.
-Okay, bye-bye.
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:57,556
Have a good trip. Okay.
Oh, my God.
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,531
Wait.
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:07,905
lt goes old job...
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:10,132
...new job...
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,536
...and you.
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:15,704
This is just something l have to do.
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:18,307
l know.
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:20,815
l love you so much.
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:23,614
l know that too.
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:37,933
Don't worry.
l'll be back before you know it.
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:39,866
Yes, it will be the same.
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:43,233
Because l know, that's how.
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:44,466
