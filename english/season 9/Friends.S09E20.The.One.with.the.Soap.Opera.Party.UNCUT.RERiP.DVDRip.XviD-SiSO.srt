00:00:01,901 --> 00:00:04,699
Hey, you guys?
What are you doing tomorrow night?
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:08,102
Oh, well, let me see.
l believe l'm....
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:10,435
Yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:14,843
Well, my agent hooked me up
with six tickets to a great play.
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,642
l could fall asleep at a play.
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:19,843
-What is it?
-lt's a one-woman play called:
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,081
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:27,386
-That sounds interesting.
-That does sound interesting.
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,156
To listen to a woman complain for
two hours. l don't think it gets bet--
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,033
l know! l know. We can drive.
We can vote. We can work.
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,694
What more do these broads want?
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,031
Well, you guys will have a great time.
l promise.
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,938
What? How come you don't have to go?
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:46,703
l wish l could, but l found out...
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,372
...that l have to be at work really early
the next day, so l can't go.
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,144
But take the extra ticket
and invite whoever you want.
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,287
Let's see. Who do l hate?
00:00:58,491 --> 00:00:59,890
Oh, sorry.
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,659
-Oops, sorry.
-Okay.
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,420
-Okay.
-Okay. Up we go.
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:05,791
-Oh, gosh, okay!
-All right.
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:17,740
Can l ask you a question?
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:21,978
Do you think it's possible
for two friends to fool around...
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:25,413
...and not have it be a big deal?
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:29,311
No, l don't think that ever works. Why?
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:32,791
-No reason.
-No, no. Rachel?
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:36,756
-Who do you want to fool around with?
-Nobody! Forget it.
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,327
Joey?
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:40,694
Maybe.
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,258
-You can't.
-Why?
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,960
Because!
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:50,837
Okay, seriously, did not understand
a word you just said.
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,875
-ln the hall.
-Okay.
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,450
-You wanna fool around with Joey?
-Yeah.
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:03,146
Ever since l had that dream about him,
l can't get it out of my head.
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:05,951
l mean, what's the big deal?
People do it all the time.
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,788
Who do you know that are friends
that just fool around?
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:13,194
Okay. Off the top of my head....
Don and Janet.
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:16,096
-Who are they?
-l know them from work.
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:19,001
-Both of them?
-No, just one of them.
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:20,969
Which one?
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:24,070
l don't know.
What were the names l just said?
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:27,008
No, Rachel, things could get
incredibly complicated.
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,638
All right. You're right. l won't do anything
with Joey. l just thought it--
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:35,686
Okay, so that's two cups of tarragon,
one pound of baking soda and a red onion?
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,852
What the hell are you cooking?
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,545
You guys won't believe
what l have to do for work today.
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:39,275
Yes, but, Ross, you chose a career
of talking about dinosaurs.
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:43,845
There are these two professors
who are joining my department...
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:48,015
...and l have to meet them here
and show them around campus.
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:49,354
What's so bad about that?
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,225
l just know they'll be
a couple of old windbags...
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,959
...wearing tweed jackets
with suede elbow patches.
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,028
Ross?
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:00,900
What? These aren't suede.
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,536
Excuse me. l'm looking for someone.
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:10,740
You don't, by any chance,
know a Ross Geller?
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,214
No.
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:18,819
Hi. Hi, l'm Ross Geller.
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,722
Oh, hi. l'm Professor Wheeler.
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:26,194
Oh, that's-- That's--
That's nice.
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:28,197
lt's good to meet you.
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:31,235
Thank you so much for taking the time
to show me around.
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,235
No, it's no big deal.
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:37,172
lf l weren't doing this, l'd just,
you know, be at the gym working out.
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:40,073
ls he gonna introduce us?
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:43,579
l think we're just blurry shapes
to him now.
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:46,747
By the way,
l really enjoyed your paper...
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:51,379
...on the connection between geographic
isolation and rapid mutagenesis.
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:54,520
l wrote that in one night.
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,754
Twenty bucks says they're married
within the month.
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,064
Well, we should probably get going.
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,028
You know, we've got a lot
of ground to cover.
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:07,900
lsn't another professor
supposed to come with us?
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,767
l don't think so.
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,772
l'm pretty sure.
A Professor Spafford from Cornell?
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:17,040
Well, he's obviously late,
and the rule in my class is:
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:21,152
lf you can't come on time,
then don't come at all.
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:24,482
An option that many of my students use.
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:27,450
-Shall we?
-We shouldn't wait for him?
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:30,892
You know what, he's a big boy.
l'm sure he'll find us, okay?
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,464
-Professor Geller?
-Oh, damn it!
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,808
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:51,609
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,249
What's happening?
00:05:57,323 --> 00:06:00,690
lt's a real shame you can't make it
to that one-woman show tonight.
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,920
l'd love to, but l gotta get up
so early the next day.
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:07,794
-You know me, work comes first.
-Oh, yeah, yeah.
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:12,837
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,938
Stupid Jan Rogers!
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,912
You are having a party tonight?
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,671
-No.
-Joey!
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,475
Yeah.
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:26,812
l'm kind of having a thing
for the <i>Days of Our Lives</i> people.
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:28,351
And you weren't gonna tell us?
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,955
How did you think you were
gonna get away with that?
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,955
l do it every year.
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,619
You do that every year?!
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,923
l didn't have to tell you that!
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,994
God, l'm stupider than Jan Rogers!
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:46,199
That's why you got us tickets
to that play, to get rid of us!
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:47,464
Yeah.
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,076
Last year is that why you sent us
to that Medieval Times restaurant?
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,472
Yeah.
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:57,941
And the year before that, you set up that
nighttime tour of that button factory?
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:01,245
l can't believe you guys went
for that one.
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,685
Why wouldn't you invite us
to your parties?
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:08,159
You're fine, okay? But everyone else acts
like an idiot around famous people.
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:11,262
Well, then, so just invite me.
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:15,029
Please, l was trying to be nice.
You're the worst one.
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:19,194
Joey, come on! Please, please?
Let me come. l will behave. l promise.
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:22,864
-l will behave. Please, please, please.
-Okay, fine. You can come.
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:26,671
But don't tell anybody else.
lt's up on the roof at <i>8</i>.
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,437
A soap-opera roof party?!
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:32,243
l'm going to a soap-opera roof party!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:37,014
And it's out of my system.
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:48,225
And then my wife and l went
on a cruise to the Galápagos.
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:52,633
There was a seafood buffet
you wouldn't believe.
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:57,908
There were clams and mussels
and oysters...
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,375
...and cracked crab...
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:02,707
...and snow crab...
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:05,373
...and king crab.
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:08,748
lt's a pity l'm allergic to shellfish.
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:13,191
So where did you get
your undergraduate degree?
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:17,090
-And that's not all l'm allergic to.
-Oh, it's not over.
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:21,393
l'm also allergic to peanuts
and cashews...
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,797
...and almonds and filberts--
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,562
So basically all nuts!
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:28,033
lnterestingly, no.
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:32,676
You're kind of playing it fast and loose
with the word ''interesting.''
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,008
lf you'll excuse me,
l'm going to use the restroom.
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,208
When l come back,
remind me to tell you...
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:44,152
...about the different types
of animal dander l'm allergic to.
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:48,322
Oh, my God!
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,689
l've lost the will to live.
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:53,888
-Let's ditch him.
-What?
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,762
While he's still in the bathroom.
l am begging you.
00:08:56,936 --> 00:09:00,736
Okay. Okay, fine,
but l just have one question for you.
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,967
When we exit, should we walk or run...
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,440
...or prance or stroll--?
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:10,048
Stop it! Stop it! He talks slow,
but he might pee fast. Okay, let's move!
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:23,859
-We actually managed to salvage the day.
-Yeah, we did.
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,430
Thanks for spending
so much time with me.
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:29,898
l'm so lucky it worked out
you don't have class on Tuesday.
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,297
Right.
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:38,406
Oh, hey, you guys, this is Charlie.
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:41,444
Charlie, this is Phoebe
and my sister, Monica.
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:44,777
-Hi.
-Charlie will be joining my department.
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:47,146
-You're a paleontologist too?
-Yeah.
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,478
Oh, okay. Now, what do you think...
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:53,989
...of Renyard's new theory of species
variegation in segmented arthropods?
00:09:55,861 --> 00:10:00,628
Well, l think he's a little out there,
but he does have some interesting ideas.
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:04,269
Oh, l'm sorry. l have to take this.
Excuse me.
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:07,131
Renyard's theory of species variegation?
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:11,402
l saw the article on your coffee table.
l memorized the title to freak you out.
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,275
So did you two have fun?
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,940
Oh, my God. She's great.
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:23,418
We have so much in common,
and she's just cool, you know? And funny.
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:27,218
And l don't know if you've noticed,
but she's a hottie!
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:28,958
Hi!
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:38,567
Hi, you guys. Listen, you know what,
l'm not feeling really well...
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:42,174
...and l don't think l'm gonna get
to go to the play.
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:43,672
Really? What's wrong?
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,038
l don't know.
l think it's kind of serious.
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:49,670
You know, l was watching this thing
on TV this morning...
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:54,081
...about Newcastle disease,
and l think l might have it.
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:56,944
Newcastle disease is
a secretion-borne virus...
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,886
...that only affects chickens
and other poultry.
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,824
Okay, who's this?
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:07,696
l'm sorry. Rachel, this is Charlie Wheeler.
She's a colleague.
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,767
Hi. Well, l would shake your hand...
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:13,234
...but l'm sure you don't want
to get my chicken disease.
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:16,970
-Rachel, can l see you for a second?
-Sure.
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:23,442
You're not sick.
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,580
What? Yes, l am!
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:28,185
Okay, then why are you all dressed up?
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:34,224
When you're sick, you do whatever
you can to make yourself feel better.
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:39,161
You just want to stay home
so you can make a move on Joey.
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:42,061
No, l heard you before.
That is so not what this is.
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:44,202
Okay, then what is this?
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,603
Okay.
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:50,469
Joey is having a secret
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,168
And he sent you guys to the play
to get rid of you.
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,341
What?!
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:57,410
What? What's going on?
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:01,212
Joey is having a secret
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:05,824
He didn't want you to know about it,
but l came over here to tell you.
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:09,917
-You came to say you were sick.
-All right, professor or detective?
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,659
Wait, Joey's having a party,
and he wasn't gonna invite us?
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:18,429
He does it every year.
That's why he's sending you to the play.
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:22,768
That's why he sent us to that medieval
restaurant and to that button factory.
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:25,240
And that horrible museum tour?
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,375
No, l arranged that.
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,147
Hey, you guys, l'm turning in.
Have fun.
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,251
We know about your party, Joey.
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,952
-What party?
-The game's over. Take off your robe.
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,893
Okay, l mean....
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:51,300
Close it up! Close it up!
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,136
Nice to meet you.
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,550
Hey, you made it! All right!
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,913
Glad you could make it.
Thanks for coming.
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,256
-Oh, my God. Kyle Lowder!
-Hi.
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,653
l love you!
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:17,489
Hey. That's why l didn't invite you.
You have to calm down, all right?
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,664
Just go get yourself a drink
or something.
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:22,733
Oh, yeah, that's what you want.
My inhibitions lowered.
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,567
Oh, my God, can you believe
we're surrounded by all this?
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,263
l can barely control myself.
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,068
Monica, you might want to remember
that you're married.
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:33,473
Where is Chandler anyway?
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,170
Oh, my God! Chandler!
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,585
Where the hell is everybody?
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,421
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,631
Chapter 1 : My First Period.
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,299
Hey, Joey said no autographs.
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:05,602
But if she's getting one,
l want one too!
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:09,839
''To Monica.'' And none of this
''best wishes'' crap. l want ''love.''
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:15,052
Okay, actually, Mon, Matthew was
giving me his phone number.
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,054
Oh, man! lf l had known
l was coming to this party...
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:20,122
...l never would've gotten married!
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,251
-lt was nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,624
-Call me.
-We will!
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:31,928
Look at you with all the guys!
l guess you've forgotten all about Joey.
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:34,868
Yeah, well, l guess l have forgotten
about Joey.
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,440
And clearly, you've forgotten
about Chandler.
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,537
Please. Chandler's the love of my life.
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:42,805
Oh, leather pants! Have mercy!
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:49,279
So do you get to go
to things like this often?
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,514
Come on, this is New York.
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:55,217
l mean, one night you're at a rooftop
party filled with soap stars...
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,589
...and the next night, you're....
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:00,461
Who am l kidding, this is so cool.
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:05,325
So it's probably gonna be hard
for you to leave Boston, huh?
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:09,372
Actually, l'm kind of happy to be leaving.
l just broke up with someone.
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,805
Oh, so sad.
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:15,040
Still, it can't be easy
for you to leave Harvard.
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:19,275
Especially after working with a Nobel
Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer.
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:22,516
Actually, Albie is the guy
l broke up with.
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:25,782
-You dated Albert Wintermeyer?
-Yeah.
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,893
And you called him ''Albie''?
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:33,926
l mean, that's like calling
Albert Einstein....
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,132
Albie.
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,798
Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:42,133
You think?
l mean, you dated the guy...
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:45,640
...who improved the accuracy
of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 1 0!
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:50,271
Yes, and while that is everything
one looks for in a boyfriend...
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,110
...he had a lot of issues.
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,149
Oh, like what?
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:57,716
l'm sorry. l don't mean to pry.
lt's just that this must be...
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:02,020
...what regular people experience
when they watch <i>Access Hollywood.</i>
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:04,257
Okay, you want the dirt?
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,557
Albie was seriously insecure.
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:09,929
He was really intimidated by the guy
l dated before him.
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:13,503
Who's intimidating to a guy
who won the Nobel Prize?
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,663
A guy who won two.
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:17,503
Two? What--?
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:20,645
Don't tell me you dated
Benjamin Hobart?
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,713
Yeah, for three years.
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:24,280
Oh, my God.
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:29,451
Have you ever been in a relationship with
someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,515
No.
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,452
But there was
my first boyfriend, Billy.
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:37,959
Oh, yeah? No Nobel Prizes for him?
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:41,395
No, but he did just win
the MacArthur ''genius grant.''
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,427
What a loser.
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,905
Some more wine?
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:54,511
Hey, Ross. How's it going with Charlie?
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,545
Oh, great. After l finish my wine...
00:16:56,715 --> 00:17:00,651
...l'm gonna blow
my average-sized brains out.
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,382
What's the matter?
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:07,184
She only dates geniuses
and Nobel Prize winners.
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,157
Oh, my God, at the Chinese restaurant
earlier today...
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:14,663
...l put chopsticks in my mouth
and pretended to be a woolly mammoth.
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,067
l always loved that.
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:20,728
Of course you would!
Your brains are smaller than mine!
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,903
l can't compete with the guys
she goes out with.
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:27,602
They're so out of my league.
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,240
Oh, my God!
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,383
-Worse?
-Oh, much, much worse.
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:35,611
l did my impression of Joan Rivers
as one of the earliest amphibians.
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,016
''Can we walk?''
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,522
-Oh, you like that?
-No.
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:42,921
What?
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:46,428
Come on! l think that's funny!
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,726
Woolly mammoth.
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,596
lt's good!
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:56,868
l bet you're thinking that now would be
a great time for an intermission, huh?
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:59,704
Oh, yes. God, yes.
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,213
Well, you're not gonna get one!
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:05,748
Because in life, there are
no intermissions, people!
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:10,818
Now, Chapter 7:
Divorce is a Four-Letter Word!
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:15,149
How could he leave me?!
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:19,557
l don't know. You seem lovely.
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:30,770
Ross, this is one of my costars, Dirk.
Dirk, this is my good friend Ross.
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,343
-Nice to meet you.
-So, what show are you on?
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:36,913
l'm not an actor.
l'm a professor of paleontology.
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,478
That's science.
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:42,782
Hey, well, listen,
l play a scientist on <i>Days.</i>
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,822
Yeah, my character just won
a Nobel Prize.
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:52,628
Ross, Dirk was wondering about the woman
you brought and if you guys are together?
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,094
Well, no, but....
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:59,169
l mean, she only goes out
with really, really smart guys.
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:02,466
Hey, l got a 690 on my SATs.
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,768
l'd lead with that.
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,844
That's it. Just sign right on the bra.
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:12,775
Monica!
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:16,085
Don't worry, Joe.
l won't come next year!
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,754
What the--?
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,189
What do you got there?
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,853
Just some boys gave me
their phone numbers.
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:28,295
Oh, really? Let me see.
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,501
Damn, that's a lot of guys.
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,103
Are you a little slutty?
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:37,971
l think l am.
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:41,135
Let me see if l approve
of any of these clowns.
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,543
-This guy wears a rug.
-Well....
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:46,149
This guy's Canadian.
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:49,212
Oh, and this guy is in a cult, okay?
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:53,290
lt'll cost you $5000 to get to level three,
and l don't feel any different.
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,820
Pass. Pa-- Oh, pass. Pass.
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:01,193
-Why? What's wrong with these guys?
-Well, nothing major.
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,699
lt's just that, you know,
they're not really good enough for you...
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,337
...and you deserve the best.
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,570
Joey, you're so sweet.
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:14,110
lt's true, but it doesn't matter. l already
know who you're going home with.
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,008
Who?
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,950
Me.
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,677
What?
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,018
Really?
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:28,520
Yeah, because we live together.
lt's a joke! lt's a joke.
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,958
Right! That's funny! l get it!
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:34,064
-Got you!
-You're funny, Joey.
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,329
Oh, my God.
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:45,138
So how did you enjoy the play?
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:50,547
Oh, my God.
Honey, l am so, so, so, so sorry.
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:51,740
Well, you should be.
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:56,081
You missed the most powerful
three hours in the history of the theater.
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,418
-You really liked it?
-Oh, yeah. l mean, at first l hated it.
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:03,789
But why wouldn't l? Because as a man,
l've been trained not to listen!
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,790
But after Chapter 1 6:
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:11,629
Fat, Single and Ready to Mingle...
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:14,931
...l was uplifted.
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,099
-Oh, really?
-Oh, yeah.
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,541
l had no idea the amazing journey
you go through as a woman.
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:24,712
Tell me--
Tell me about your first period.
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:27,715
No!
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,048
Did somebody sign your bra?
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:35,216
So l got it when l was 1 3.
Very difficult.
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:41,092
Hey, Ross? So listen,
about you and the dinosaur girl?
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:44,929
Are you really just gonna let
a couple of Nobel Prizes scare you off?
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:47,435
What is that?
Come on, a piece of paper?
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:49,665
lt's actually a million-dollar prize.
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:52,000
Go, Charlie!
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,943
But my point is...
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:59,015
...okay, so she dated them,
but she also broke up with them.
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:04,746
Maybe she's looking to, you know,
slum it with some average Joe Ph.D.
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:10,754
Yeah, maybe, and l do have
my whole career in front of me.
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,362
l mean....
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:15,466
l could still win a Nobel Prize.
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:21,470
Although the last two papers
l've written were widely discredited.
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:28,336
You're so much more than just brains.
You are sweet and kind and funny.
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:30,080
And sexy.
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:33,308
Okay, well, give her a chance
to see all that.
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,652
Yeah. Yeah. You're right.
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:38,346
-Thanks. l'm gonna go find her.
-Good for you.
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:43,426
And your paper on punctuated equilibrium
in the Devonian Era was topnotch.
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:45,654
Stop going through my stuff!
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:52,968
l just wanted to let you know
l've changed my mind.
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:55,163
l'm gonna do it.
l'm gonna kiss Joey.
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,832
No! You can't!
Friends hooking up is a bad idea.
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,978
Please! What about you and Chandler?
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:04,115
That's different. l was drunk and stupid.
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:06,648
Well, hello?
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:11,016
What about all the guys that you got
the phone numbers from?
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:13,749
-Why don't you just kiss one of them.
-l could...
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:17,383
...but l don't want to.
l want to kiss Joey.
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:22,156
All right. l think it's a big mistake,
but it's your decision.
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,395
l'm gonna do it.
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:31,098
