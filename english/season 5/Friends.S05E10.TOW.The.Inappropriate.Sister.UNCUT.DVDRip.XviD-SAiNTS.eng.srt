00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:09,036
-What are you doing?
-I reorganized the fridge.
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:12,767
See? Bottom shelf,
meats and dairy.
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:16,282
Middle shelf, fruits and vegetables.
00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:20,144
And top shelf, expired products.
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:22,415
Why are you doing this?
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:24,816
Because I'm bored out of my mind.
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:28,891
I've already been to the bank,
post office and dry cleaners.
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:32,565
Dude, you just described
seven days' worth of stuff.
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:36,493
Spread it out a little.
Haven't you ever been unemployed?
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm not unemployed.
I'm on sabbatical.
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:42,139
Hey, don't get religious
on me, okay?
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:46,777
A guy in your position needs to be
better at relaxing.
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:50,471
That's why we have comfortable chairs.
Here, sit down.
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:53,945
Ready? Watch.
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,781
And then...
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,287
-So, what? We just sit?
-Oh, no, no.
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:05,692
We're not gonna just sit.
Watch.
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:12,065
-Hello, Chandler Bing.
-Hello, Mr. Bing.
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:14,196
I love you.
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:17,807
All right, whoever this is,
stop calling me!
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:22,179
It's been 6 months!
It's not funny!
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:27,512
I can see you, Mr. Bing.
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:30,623
You look sexy in your new suit.
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,521
Leave me alone!
For the love of God, leave me alone!
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,989
And that's Wednesday.
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:42,794
The One with
The Inappropriate Sister
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,909
Hey, you guys! Guess what?
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,349
The British are coming?
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:36,087
Oh, you and your ways.
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:42,257
Since it's Christmas,
I'm going to be collecting donations.
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,521
I have my bell
and later on I get my bucket.
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,660
I'll be spreading joy
to the people.
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:52,872
Last year I spread a little joy,
but not enough.
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:55,700
So this year I'm doing the whole city.
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:01,746
I knew a girl in high school who
did that. She was very popular.
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:06,178
It's weird, you're starting to sound
a lot like Chandler lately.
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,150
That is so not true.
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:13,286
So, Phoebe, where are you
doing your bell-ringing?
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,154
They gave me a great spot
right by Macy's.
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,796
They never give a good spot
to a rookie...
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:23,560
...but I'm the only one who can say
"Merry Christmas" in 25 languages.
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,231
I lied!
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,564
Oh, my God. Here's Danny.
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,673
Just watch this.
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,074
See? Still pretending
he's not interested.
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,249
He's coming over.
Pretend we've forgotten who he is.
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,054
-Hey, guys.
-Hey, Danny.
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,155
Oh, Danny! Hey!
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:54,491
You know Rachel. She's nice.
She's not bad to look at, right?
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:55,826
Thanks, Mon.
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,695
Of course.
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:00,664
Do you want to go out
on a date with her?
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:04,440
Absolutely. Is Friday okay?
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,440
Friday is perfect.
She can't wait.
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:12,380
On the date, I'll be able
to talk to her directly?
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:14,378
See you Friday.
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:19,788
Okay, what the hell was that?
You know what? Don't answer me.
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,958
I have a date with Danny!
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:27,862
All right, it's 4:30,
I guess my lunch break is over.
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,566
-What are you guys gonna do?
-If you're going back to work...
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:35,071
...I'll probably just hang out.
You know, make some calls.
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,114
How could I not get the part?
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:47,116
The play was about a 29-year-old
Italian actor from Queens!
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,346
Well, Talia Shire
suddenly became available.
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:52,217
She's a woman!
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:55,725
What can I say? She nailed it!
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,125
Is there anything else?
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,631
You'll just say no again, but...
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:04,369
...gay porn?
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,706
Happy holidays!
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,805
Feliz Navidad!
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:14,076
Allo and Merry Christmas!
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,872
Oh, thank you, sir!
Here's some joy.
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,878
-How's it going?
-It's going okay.
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,020
Good. Let me help you out.
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,485
Oh, thanks!
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:31,829
Is that a new suede jacket?
It looks really expensive.
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,893
Yeah. I guess.
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,567
Just get your nails done?
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,608
Yes, Phoebe, but this
is all I have, okay?
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:46,845
Thanks. Happy holidays!
Here's your joy.
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,239
Thank you! Happy holidays and
Wait.
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:54,111
-You can't take money out.
-I'm making change for the bus.
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,914
Can't you leave the
dollar for the poor?
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,283
I'm poor.
I gotta take the bus.
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:02,458
Okay, season's greetings and everything,
but still
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:03,889
Bite me, blondie!
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:11,027
I'm going to give him
something besides joy. Just
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:18,167
I can't believe
I didn't get that part.
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,605
I'm sorry, man.
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,513
What you should do...
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:25,307
...is make something happen
for yourself.
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:27,748
You know, like write a play.
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,512
Or a movie. What about those
Good Will Hunting guys?
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:35,522
Be realistic, you know?
If I did write something...
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:39,424
...what are the chances I could
get those guys to star in it?
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,527
Wait a second.
I could star in it!
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:45,793
Or that.
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:50,641
I can't write.
I mean, I'm an actor.
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,905
I could act like a writer. Here...
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,783
But see? Nada.
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:06,484
I don't have the discipline
that it takes. I can't do it.
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,384
I'll help you.
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:12,724
Yeah. I'll make up a schedule
and make sure you stick to it.
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,229
Plus, it'll give me something to do.
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,766
You'd do that for me?
Thanks.
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,337
We'll start slow. All you have
to come up with tonight...
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:24,007
...is the name
of your main character.
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:26,406
-Done.
-And it can't be Joey.
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,340
-It's not.
-Or Joseph.
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:36,477
What's up?
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:39,681
I just saw Danny on the subway
with a girl...
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,757
...and he had his arm
around her.
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,320
Honey, I'm sorry.
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,928
You should be.
This is all your fault.
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:50,400
You meddled in our relationship!
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,365
You had no relationship!
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,096
But I was doing my thing
and everything...
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,400
...was going according to the plan!
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,670
Oh, God, stop with the plan!
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:04,241
So what if you saw him
with a girl?
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,350
That doesn't mean anything.
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:11,080
You'll go out with Danny and be
so charming he'll forget all about...
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,417
...that stupid subway girl.
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,718
She was kind of stupid.
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:19,929
You're right.
I'm just going to go on the date.
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,533
I'm just going to go on the date.
That is the new plan.
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:27,632
Hurry!
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:46,091
-How do you spell "suspicious"?
-Why?
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:50,089
I think this character is going
to be suspicious about stuff.
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:57,164
Chandler Bing, seven!
Chandler Bing, zero!
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,932
You're driving me crazy with that.
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:01,902
-I'll stop.
-Don't stop.
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:05,770
Move the bowl further away.
Ross could make that shot.
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:14,651
Well, you suck. But at least you suck
at a man's game now.
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,785
-Want to play?
-I can't play games.
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:22,290
Ross'll be home soon. I have to write
five pages to stick to his schedule.
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:26,123
So play for 30 minutes,
then write until he gets home.
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:27,855
All right.
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,829
But listen, what do you say we...
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:33,799
...crank it up a notch?
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:35,195
I'm intrigued.
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:39,034
All right. All we need
is a little lighter fluid.
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:42,372
But be careful.
I want our security deposit back.
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:46,448
We said goodbye to that
when we invented hammer darts.
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:51,054
Do you even remember which part
of the wall is not spackle?
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:57,027
Thank you! Happy holiday.
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:03,393
No, that's trash, young lady.
You can't
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:06,833
Stop that young lady!
She donated trash!
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,901
The charity's on fire!
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:15,477
Help!
Thank you. I need that!
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,712
What is this?
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:21,479
It's 9:00 in the morning!
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:25,046
All right. "A room.
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:27,849
A man enters. He looks suspicious."
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:34,122
That's it?
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:38,161
You're supposed to
have five pages done by now...
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,566
...including an exciting incident.
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:47,204
What is all this?
"The Official Rulebook of Fireball."
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,042
That's the game we played.
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:54,686
It's great. You take a
tennis ball, a bowl and lighter
00:10:57,556 --> 00:11:00,957
This is helping your career?
You wanted to be an actor.
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:04,458
Not the creator of
"Crazy Lawsuit Game."
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,925
You're right.
I'll get back to work.
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:10,760
Shame on you! You should know better!
Joey needs to work.
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,904
Now come on.
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:17,571
You can have this back
when the five pages are done.
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:32,252
-I had a nice time tonight.
-So did I.
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,325
I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:47,228
I'd love to ask you in,
but my sister's visiting.
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,773
-I think she's asleep on the couch.
-Your sister?
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,444
Your sister's asleep on the couch?
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:58,843
I saw you with her on the subway
and now she's asleep on the couch!
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:03,087
-I thought I heard you.
-Hey, great, you're up.
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:05,414
Rachel, my sister Krista.
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:06,818
Nice to meet you.
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:09,926
I wish you'd warned me.
I'd have fixed myself up.
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:13,029
-Like it would help.
-You are so bad.
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:14,323
-You are.
-You are.
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,000
-You are.
-You are!
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:18,702
You are so dead.
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:21,099
I'm gonna get you.
Come here!
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,209
It's very nice to meet you.
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:41,058
Nobody!
Nobody respects the bucket!
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,757
You wouldn't believe
what people put in here!
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:48,058
Does this look like a
garbage can to you?
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,461
Does it look like an ashtray?
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:52,830
Does it look like a urinal?
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:59,007
-So you going back out there?
-Yeah, but I won't take any more crap.
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,678
No more Mrs. Nice Bucket.
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:06,246
Good. You're tough.
You lived on the street.
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,920
I'll go back to being
Street Phoebe.
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:15,317
But not totally back. Street Phoebe
wouldn't be friends with you guys.
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,489
Can I ask you guys something?
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:26,466
I don't have brothers, so I don't know,
but did you guys wrestle?
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:28,299
-Oh, yeah.
-All the time.
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,271
In fact, I was undefeated.
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:34,776
Well, you weighed 200 pounds.
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,808
Still, I was quick as a cat.
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,316
I met Danny's sister yesterday.
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,854
-That was the girl on the subway.
-You're kidding.
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:48,322
They were very, you know...
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,217
...wrestle-y.
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,691
But I guess that's normal?
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,795
We don't wrestle now.
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:59,560
Not since I got too
strong for you.
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,698
Too strong for me?
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,738
You wanna go right now?
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:08,540
I'll take you right now, buddy!
You wanna go?
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,004
Oh, fine.
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,546
Ready?
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:16,652
Wrestle!
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:22,826
Okay, you know what?
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,588
Actually, that helps a lot.
Thanks.
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:33,561
Let's go!
The puck drops in 20 minutes!
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:35,270
Joey's not going.
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,771
I didn't finish my five pages.
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,705
Finish them tomorrow.
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,538
Tomorrow he's redoing
yesterday's pages.
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:47,343
Yesterday's pages
did not reflect my best work.
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:51,755
Cut him some slack. If he relaxes,
he'll get some work done.
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:55,516
I think he's been relaxing enough,
thanks to you...
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,056
...and Fireball.
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:02,557
If you think Fireball's relaxing,
you've never played.
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,526
You're doing this
because you're bored.
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:07,898
It's not his fault
you're unemployed.
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,768
I am not unemployed.
I'm on sabbatical!
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,402
Guys, don't fight.
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:17,082
And I'm doing this because
I am Joey's friend.
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:20,285
If you were a friend,
you'd be doing the same.
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,713
So being a friend means
being a jerk?
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:26,118
If it does, then you're
an amazing friend of mine.
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,150
Let's settle this
over a game of Fireball.
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:34,059
-I'll unhook the smoke detectors.
-Let's settle this right now.
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,565
There. Now no one's going
to the game.
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,438
-I paid for those!
-You said you would, but you didn't.
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:43,869
Oh, yeah.
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:53,447
We finally get
to the top of the mountain...
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:56,587
...and airhead here
forgets the camera.
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:59,689
The same thing
happened to me one time.
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:03,661
When did that happen to you?
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,622
Remember? We were jogging
and saw that bird.
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:11,200
I wanted to take a picture,
but I didn't have my camera.
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:14,201
Chasing the churro
guy is not jogging.
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:19,139
Oh, this is so good.
You have got to try it.
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:34,125
-Damn. I got it on my pants.
-Here, I'll get it.
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,662
We better take them off
or the stain will set.
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:48,067
-I want to wear them tonight.
-Oh, great.
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,299
Okay, bye. Oh, my God!
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:55,572
-That was unbelievable.
-See? I told you.
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,145
Yeah. Sorry.
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,146
I don't believe they're
brother and sister.
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,410
They're brother and sister?!
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:04,620
I guess you'll have to cancel your date.
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:07,282
And call their mother.
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:22,767
Wait a minute. Open your hand.
Let me take a look.
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:26,943
Quarter, dime. Lint?
Not interested in that.
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,506
What's this?
A Canadian coin?
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,739
Get out of here!
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:37,114
No drinks near the bucket.
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:41,120
Set it down there and then
you can make a contribution.
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:44,894
You can leave the "hurt bunny"
look over there too.
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:46,755
Hi, Bob.
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,459
I thought I told you
to get out of here!
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:54,094
Phoebe, we've been
getting complaints.
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:57,604
We're moving you to a
less high-profile spot.
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:02,611
-Ginger's taking this corner.
-That chick can't handle my corner.
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:06,244
Look, either you leave
or we remove you.
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:07,808
Fine.
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:18,090
I'll give you one pointer.
Look out for that bitch.
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:32,573
-I thought we said 7.
-You know what? Let's skip it.
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,472
What? Why?
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:39,115
You and your sister seem to have
a very special bond
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:42,947
Oh, great.
That "special bond" again.
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:48,653
Why do women have a problem
with my being close to my sister?
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:52,456
-I don't know, but
-Do you have brothers?
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:57,667
No, I have two sisters. But one
has a very masculine energy.
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:01,797
-Are you close?
-No. They're not very nice people.
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:07,478
I like you.
I think this could go somewhere.
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,672
So I'm close to my family.
Don't let it stand in our way.
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,180
Well, I don't know...
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,711
When you put it that way
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:20,447
Danny? Hurry up.
The bath's getting cold.
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,027
I'll see you later.
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:33,569
There's some kids
playing in the street.
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,172
Want to go give them a project,
ruin their day?
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:41,044
If they have a ball,
you could stick razors in it...
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:44,841
...and teach them a new game:
"Gonna-Need-Stitches Ball."
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:51,088
Hey, guys! I was at the library.
I already finished my five pages.
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:54,588
Now we can go
to the Ranger game last night!
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:59,255
No, dude.
Ross tore up the tickets.
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:08,433
I guess without so many distractions
it's easier for you to focus?
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:13,768
Also without somebody breathing
down your neck all the livelong day!
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:19,943
The important thing is, I finished it.
And I think it's really good.
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:24,621
But it would help if I could hear it.
Would you guys read it for me?
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,748
-Yeah, all right.
-All right.
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,394
"It's a typical New York apartment.
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:35,566
Two guys are hanging out."
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:39,926
"Hey, man."
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,430
"What is up?"
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:47,808
"About yesterday.
I was really wrong. I am sorry."
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:51,549
"No, it was me. I'm sorry.
I overreacted."
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:56,119
"Maybe it was both of us.
But we had our best friend's inter
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:03,426
But we had our best friend's
interest at heart."
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:05,990
"Could I be more sorry?"
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,562
"I don't know. I am one sorry...
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,572
...polontologist."
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,478
All right, Joey, we get it.
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:26,442
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry too.
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:29,519
Keep reading.
The good part's coming up.
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:35,116
"I am sorry, Chandler."
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,522
"I am sorry, Ross."
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,997
"A handsome man enters."
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:50,264
"I don't know what you're talking
about, but I'd like to thank you both.
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:53,137
You. You wouldn't let me
give up on myself.
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:54,710
And you.
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,948
You co-created Fireball."
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:00,374
"The End."
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:03,814
This took you all day?
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:06,957
No, this took five minutes.
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:12,027
I spent the rest of the day coming up
with new Ultimate Fireball!
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:22,904
It's a typical New York apartment.
Two girls are just hanging out. Go.
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:27,237
-"Hi, how are you doing, Kelly?"
-"I'm doing just fine.
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:30,243
God, Tiffany, you smell so great."
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:33,816
"It's my new perfume.
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:38,489
Why don't you come closer where
you can really appreciate it?"
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,620
-Joey, you are sick.
-This is disgusting.
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,763
I'm not reading this.
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:50,025
Wait, wait, wait!
The handsome man was about to enter!
