00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:06,470
-Good! You guys are all here.
-What's up?
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,732
I have a job interview
at Ralph Lauren tomorrow.
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:11,766
Congratulations!
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:14,811
Oh, boy.
That guy's underwear sucks!
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:18,407
-What?
-Well, I got this pair marked "XS."
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:22,449
Let me tell you, there was no room
for excess anything in there.
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:25,447
I'll be the coordinator
of the women's collection.
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:29,924
I'll work right under the director.
It's the perfect job for me!
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,394
If you nail the interview,
you'll get it.
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:35,066
You want to work
on your interview skills?
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:38,161
Let's start with the handshake.
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:43,437
Very good handshake.
Good wrist action.
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:45,476
Let me try.
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:49,445
Oh, my God!
What did I ever do to you?
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:51,013
Did I squeeze too hard?
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:54,649
Let's just say
I'm glad I'm not Chandler.
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:00,152
The One with Rachel's Inadvertent Kiss
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:48,571
That's right, Ross.
I can see you in your new apartment.
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:52,300
Same as yesterday,
same as the day before.
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:54,541
Is he doing
his "shark attack" bit?
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:57,476
No. Oh, wait!
There he goes.
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,395
Very funny, Ross.
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,499
Very lifelike and funny.
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:21,930
No, no.
I wasn't waving at you, lady.
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,342
Whoa, maybe I was.
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:30,212
This hot girl in Ross' building
is flirting with me.
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,681
Get in there, man.
Flirt back. Mix it up!
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,445
Yeah, I'm down with that.
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,252
Okay, here goes.
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:43,093
How...
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:44,896
...you...
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,362
...doing?
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:53,205
It worked! She's waving me over.
I'll be right over.
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:55,703
Let's see,
she's on the third floor...
00:02:57,443 --> 00:03:00,708
-She is pretty, huh?
-Tell me about it.
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:03,949
No, no! I'm not with her.
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,913
That's just Monica.
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,365
Hey, Joey!
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,869
Great stuff, huh?
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:30,803
This your place?
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,410
Yeah, of course it is.
Come on in.
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:36,980
Go by the window.
You can pretend to be surfing.
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:41,643
I counted.
You're not supposed to live here!
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,219
Oh, man!
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,017
What happened?
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:53,962
I ended up at Ross' place.
I must have miscounted or something.
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:57,397
Damn! She's not there anymore.
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:00,936
Look, Ross is doing
his "watching TV" bit.
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,403
No, Joe, I think
he's just watching TV.
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:19,584
We've lost visual contact
with the suspect.
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:22,317
Okay, now I really have to go.
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:25,495
It's so unfair that
our date has to get cut short...
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:28,496
...just because some guy
shot at a store clerk.
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:32,669
-I know, but it's my job.
-Then maybe I could come too.
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,773
Suspect has just emerged
naked from the sewer.
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,636
All right, you go.
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,814
-Oh, God!
-What?
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,014
Oh, I just miss him so much!
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:58,629
For just a week,
you guys are close.
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:02,062
Yeah, it's weird.
I can't help it. He's so sweet.
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,896
He's like this little
puppy dog, you know?
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,972
But like a really tough one
who shoots bad guys.
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,872
I love the beginning parts
of relationships.
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,274
You can't keep your hands
off each other.
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,676
I know. It is the best.
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:21,311
How long did that last
for you and Chandler?
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:24,819
What? It's still going on.
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,891
Come on, seriously.
When did it end?
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:32,424
I am serious. We're all over
each other all the time.
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:36,101
Okay, you know where you are
better than I do.
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,497
Why don't you just calm down?
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:44,703
Get all your facts before you tell
everybody you're the only hot couple.
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,612
God, I woke the beast.
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:52,576
I was wrong, obviously.
I just misspoke. It's okay.
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:54,184
It is okay.
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:57,754
As long as you know Chandler and I
are also hot and fiery.
00:05:57,957 --> 00:05:59,254
Just as hot as you.
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,687
I mean, our flame...
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,224
It is on fire!
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:06,554
Here's your broom back.
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,631
You are so cute!
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:19,975
The cute bar keeps getting lower
and lower, doesn't it?
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:26,548
How'd the interview go?
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:30,689
Horrible! I did the stupidest,
most embarrassing thing.
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,826
Did you say you wanted to have sex
with his wife then fall off your chair?
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,464
Did you get drunk on the way over there?
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:44,900
Well, that explains why you didn't do
the other stuff.
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:46,633
So, what happened?
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:50,002
It was horrible!
And the interview part went so well.
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:51,676
I even made him laugh.
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,142
He said something about a boat...
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:59,080
...and I was like, "Well, yeah,
if you've got enough life jackets."
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:05,719
Trust me.
It was actually very funny.
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:09,326
Anyway, we were
saying goodbye and...
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,584
What happened?
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,524
We were shaking hands...
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:14,757
...and he leaned in toward me.
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,992
Maybe he was opening the door...
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:20,570
...but I totally
misread him and I...
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,578
You kissed him?
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,943
I didn't know what else to do!
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,177
You could have tried...
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,012
...not kissing him.
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:37,711
Thanks, Chandler.
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:41,655
A guy from Ralph Lauren called.
You got a second interview.
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,887
Monica, that's not funny.
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,860
Oh, okay.
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:50,935
A guy from Ralph Lauren called
You got a second interview
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,334
Oh, my God, Monica,
you better be serious.
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:59,376
You just told me to be funny!
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:02,810
Oh, my God. I can't believe it!
I got a second interview.
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,042
That kiss isn't looking like
such a mistake now, is it?
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:09,216
You don't think that's
why he wants me back?
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:10,683
Yeah!
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:12,953
No?
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:15,550
What are you talking about?
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,687
I accidentally kissed him
in the interview...
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,695
...and now he wants me back...
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,836
...because, "Let's bring back
the girl who kisses everybody!"
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:27,563
Come on, Rach.
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:31,243
What if he thinks
I'll just sleep with him?
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:33,807
He wants you back because
you're right for the job.
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:37,847
Maybe. I don't know. Oh, God!
How could I be so stupid?
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,986
Rachel, don't say that. I think
you just need a hug from Joey.
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,246
Come on. Come on.
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:47,416
She's back! Hot girl's back!
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,723
Well, I'm not totally back yet,
but I appreciate it.
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,762
No. In Ross' building.
She's back!
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,094
Wait there.
I'll be over in a second.
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:58,870
One, two, three...
Got it!
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,177
I gotta check out this hot girl.
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,907
There she is!
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:19,182
Damn it! Did you move?
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,254
Yes.
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:24,758
I lived with you for a while.
Then I found this place.
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,465
I'm Ross.
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:46,616
Do you happen to have
a hot girl in there?
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,679
No, I'm all alone.
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,790
Yeah. Sorry about that.
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,957
Hey, little girl.
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:06,662
Is your mommy or sister or babysitter,
by any chance, a hot girl?
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,268
-Daddy!
-Later, girl!
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:17,141
Oh, man!
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,650
Hot girl?
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,184
Hot girl!
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:32,323
Hi, Rachel. Come on in.
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,033
-It's nice to see you again.
-Thank you.
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:41,330
What?
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,034
-Excuse me?
-Yeah, let me
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:49,110
Okay, I see what's going on here.
Now, look...
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,681
...I'm sorry if I gave you
the wrong impression.
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:55,945
But I am not some hussy who will
just sleep around to get ahead.
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:59,715
Even though I kissed you,
that does not give you...
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:04,726
...the right to demand sex from me!
I do not want this job that bad.
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,828
Good day, sir.
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:14,263
If you're going in there to see Mr. Zelner,
I hope you're ready to put out.
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,536
I am.
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,943
You are not gonna believe...
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,847
...what that sleazeball
from Ralph Lauren did to me!
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:35,189
Okay, that's amazing!
How did you know that?
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:37,625
You got ink on your lip.
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:51,075
What do you say, maybe,
sometime I hold your gun?
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,108
We're not supposed to do that.
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,844
What could happen? I mean
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,709
Yeah. I'm gonna say no.
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,716
-Do you want to see a movie tonight?
-We can't. We already have plans.
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:07,655
What are you doing?
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,297
Well, same thing we did all day.
Just hang out at Gary's apartment.
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,490
He is so amazing.
We never left the bedroom.
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,634
But have fun at the movie.
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,567
Well, we're not seeing a movie.
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:27,578
Then why did you ask us
if we wanted to go?
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,814
Because I just wanted
to know what you were doing...
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,042
...so you wouldn't walk in
on me and Chandler...
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,311
...while we were doing it all night.
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,751
Will you excuse me?
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,921
Chandler?
Can I see you for a second?
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,900
-We have got to beat them!
-Why?
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,666
Because Gary and Phoebe think
they're a hotter couple than us.
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,043
So?
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:03,614
So we've gotta go have a lot of sex
and prove them wrong!
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,415
You've got to stop this
competitive thing. It's crazy.
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,716
Just to impress them, you want us
to have sex over and over...
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:14,893
...and I'm saying no to this, why?
Get your coat!
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:27,598
Excuse me.
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,675
You should check this out.
Tell the other tenants.
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,077
Apparently, he's looking
for some kind of hot girl.
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:41,944
Who isn't?
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,757
I don't think we've met.
I'm Ross.
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,131
I know. You're the guy who
wouldn't chip in for the handyman.
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,267
Never mind.
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:02,733
I actually thought it was unfair
the way everyone reacted.
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,910
I mean, you had just moved in.
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:07,609
I had just moved in!
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:09,610
Thank you!
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:11,881
Listen...
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:14,117
Jen.
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:17,750
I know this may sound a little...
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:23,557
But would you want to grab
a cup of coffee sometime?
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:26,460
Sure, that would be nice.
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:31,928
My number's on there.
Give me a call.
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:33,661
I will give you a call.
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,269
-I'll see you later.
-Okay.
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:43,347
I forgot my paper.
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:50,649
That was amazing.
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:54,821
Phoebe and Gary are so gonna
hear about this at dinner.
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,318
That was amazing.
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,827
We are the hottest, huh?
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,627
No one is hotter than we are.
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,964
-We're the best.
-No, you're the best.
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,666
-No, you're the best.
-No, you're the best.
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,975
I am the best.
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:16,709
Hey, guys.
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:18,547
What you been doing?
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:27,015
Isn't that the girl who waved at you?
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:30,059
I don't know, but I can
see through your sheet.
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:34,388
Yeah, that's her.
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:37,568
You know, it doesn't matter.
I'll never meet her.
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:40,033
It's impossible to find her apartment!
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:43,833
She lives in some hot-girl
parallel universe or something.
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:46,301
What are you talking about?
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:49,940
She lives on the 2nd floor,
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:53,880
No, she lives on the 3rd floor,
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:57,384
No. Those first two windows,
that's the lobby.
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:01,047
That other window is the stairway.
You've been counting wrong.
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:04,455
I did not know that!
Thank you, Monica.
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:07,564
I almost lost another girl
because of counting!
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:14,003
-So you ready?
-Yeah, I'll just get my coat.
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:17,207
-Could you get that?
-Sure.
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,079
No! No!
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:38,723
First, I would like to say
thank you for seeing me again.
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:40,124
That's all right.
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:44,803
But I feel obligated to tell you
that this meeting is being videotaped.
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:54,771
Well, first, I would like to start
by apologizing for kissing you...
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,072
...and for yelling at you.
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:58,880
Fair enough.
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:04,249
Now, you're probably going to hire
one of the people who did not...
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,992
...yell at you and storm out.
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:11,957
And I think that's a big mistake.
And here's why.
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:16,668
I made a huge fool of myself,
and I came back. That shows courage.
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:21,329
When I thought you wanted sex
in exchange for this job, I said no.
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,097
That shows integrity.
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:26,072
And I was not afraid
to stand up for myself...
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,506
...and that shows courage.
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,246
Now, I know that I've
already said courage...
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,852
...but you've got to have courage.
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:42,923
And finally, when I thought
you were making sexual advances...
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:45,289
...I said no,
and I was not litigious.
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,658
So there you go!
You got courage...
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:51,495
...you got integrity,
you got courage again...
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:54,295
...and not litigious.
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:57,700
Look, Mr...
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:00,275
Zelner.
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:01,504
I knew that!
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:03,772
Oh, I knew that.
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,311
I really, really want this job.
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:11,512
And I think I would be
really good at it.
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:16,292
You know what?
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:20,464
I may regret this...
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,062
...but I'll give you a shot.
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:25,862
You are? Really?
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,804
Thank you. Oh, God!
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:31,801
Would it be inappropriate
if I gave you a hug?
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,541
Well, how about a handshake?
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:38,312
Oh, God! I'm sorry!
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,980
I did not mean to touch that!
I mean, you!
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:46,084
There!
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:51,154
I'm gonna leave.
Thank you very much.
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,259
Hey, I'll see you Monday.
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,059
Are you tired?
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:02,330
You better believe he's tired
after the day we had!
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:05,338
If you know what I mean.
Do you know what I mean?
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:08,774
Honey, the tortilla chips
know what you mean.
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:12,546
Do you like that badge I got you?
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,446
Oh, yeah, it's so cool.
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:19,686
Now, I gotta go.
Officer Bing's got a 10-100.
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,418
That's pee-pee.
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:29,625
Phoebe, you have a twig in your hair.
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:35,471
We kind of took a detour
on our way over here.
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:39,302
We were strolling through the park
and no one was around, so...
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:41,903
-You didn't.
-We did!
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:46,812
We violated section 12,
paragraph 7 of the criminal code.
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:51,387
The park, huh?
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,922
Public place.
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:58,892
I hear you.
Can you excuse me for a second?
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,567
Hi, Chandler.
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:12,003
Monica, this is the men's room.
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:14,769
Isn't it?
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:18,306
Yes, it is.
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:22,419
I've always found the men's bathroom
very sexual. Haven't you?
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,319
No.
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,082
And if I did, I don't think
we'd be going out.
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:32,225
Okay, I don't want
to disappoint you...
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:36,834
...and I really don't want to disappoint
the guy in the second stall...
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,697
Sorry, man.
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,700
But come on, this is getting ridiculous.
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,808
Come on, we can't let them win!
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:50,247
We've proved that we are hot, okay?
So why are you obsessed about this?
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,211
Phoebe and Gary are in that...
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:54,918
..."can't keep their hands
off each other" phase!
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,585
So?
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:01,219
It makes me really sad that
we're not really there anymore.
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:04,189
Oh, is that what
this has all been about?
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:09,029
Wasn't it a lot more exciting
when we were...
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,564
...all over each other all the time?
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:15,069
Yeah, that was great.
That was really great.
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,710
But the truth is, I'm more
excited about where we are now.
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:20,974
-Really?
-Yeah.
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:24,546
I've never been in a relationship
this long before.
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,242
To get past the beginning and
still want to be around each other...
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,216
...I think that's incredible.
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,356
And the fact that
this is happening with you...
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:35,852
...I think that's pretty exciting.
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,263
That's so sweet.
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:47,305
I know that I was acting
a little crazy...
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:49,767
...but I feel the same way.
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,641
You know what I just realized?
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:59,442
You just freaked out
about our relationship.
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,050
-I did not.
-Yes, you did!
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:02,776
Admit it. You freaked out!
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,456
I freaked out a little.
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,387
A little?
You freaked out bigtime, okay?
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,628
And I fixed it!
We have switched places.
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:15,994
I am the relationship king, and you
are the crazy, irrational screwup!
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,299
And now we're back.
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,410
I cannot believe Ross is buying this.
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,917
Thank God!
I can't watch him anymore.
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:38,680
You guys ready?
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:42,693
By the way, thank you for
loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:47,463
Man, they cannot get enough!
