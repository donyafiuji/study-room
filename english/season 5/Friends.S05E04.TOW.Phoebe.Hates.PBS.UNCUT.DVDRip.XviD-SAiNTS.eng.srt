00:00:08,858 --> 00:00:10,189
Come in.
00:00:10,694 --> 00:00:13,219
I've been waiting for you.
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:17,491
Hi, I just
00:00:18,735 --> 00:00:20,532
Oh, my God!
Monica!
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,237
Oh, my God!
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,031
I'm sorry! I was
00:00:24,574 --> 00:00:26,007
I was taking a nap.
00:00:26,242 --> 00:00:29,336
Since when do you
take naps in that position?
00:00:31,548 --> 00:00:34,881
Tell me you were waiting for a guy.
Please tell me.
00:00:35,085 --> 00:00:37,110
Yes, I was.
A guy.
00:00:37,921 --> 00:00:39,855
From work.
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,217
I'm seeing a guy from work!
00:00:44,728 --> 00:00:48,858
That cute waiter guy that looks like
a nonthreatening Ray Liotta?
00:00:50,366 --> 00:00:51,856
That one!
00:00:52,102 --> 00:00:55,731
Give me a second.
I'm just going to grab a jacket.
00:00:55,939 --> 00:00:59,875
When I get back,
I want every little detail.
00:01:02,912 --> 00:01:04,777
Maybe that's him.
00:01:08,718 --> 00:01:10,743
It's just Joey and Ross.
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:12,620
Why aren't you at the movie?
00:01:12,889 --> 00:01:16,256
Ross was so loud, they threw us out.
00:01:16,459 --> 00:01:19,826
I had to talk loud
because the movie was loud!
00:01:22,065 --> 00:01:25,762
-He's talking to London.
-Did he get in touch with Emily?
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:30,906
No, not yet. He's hoping that someone
will help him get in touch with her.
00:01:31,107 --> 00:01:35,806
I don't care if I said some
other girl's name, you prissy old twit!
00:01:37,781 --> 00:01:40,011
Way to suck up to the family!
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:52,454
I'm so glad you're all here. My office
finally got wrinkle-free fax paper!
00:01:55,331 --> 00:01:57,128
The One Where Phoebe Hates PBS
00:02:42,779 --> 00:02:47,910
Hi, is this Nanny Hopkins?
I'm looking for Emily.
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,210
Waltham.
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:55,485
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is this 0-1-1-4-4-7-4-2...
00:02:55,658 --> 00:03:00,721
...9-3-4-7-4-2-6-7?
00:03:02,065 --> 00:03:04,499
Oh, it's "4-3," not 4-2.
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:07,329
Well, which 4-2?
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:12,030
No, no! Vomit tux!
00:03:13,042 --> 00:03:15,067
Don't worry,
I had it dry-cleaned.
00:03:15,245 --> 00:03:16,234
Vomit tux?
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,745
Who vomited on?
00:03:19,048 --> 00:03:21,744
You know what?
What you up to, Joe?
00:03:22,252 --> 00:03:24,880
They're doing
this telethon thing on TV.
00:03:25,154 --> 00:03:27,645
And my agent
got me a job as cohost!
00:03:27,857 --> 00:03:29,347
That's great!
00:03:29,592 --> 00:03:33,494
A little good deed for PBS,
plus some TV exposure.
00:03:33,763 --> 00:03:36,561
That's the kind of math
Joey likes to do.
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:39,534
Oh, PBS!
00:03:40,436 --> 00:03:43,234
-What's wrong with PBS?
-What's right with them?
00:03:44,774 --> 00:03:46,503
Why don't you like PBS?
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:51,840
Right after my Mom killed herself,
I was in a bad place, personally.
00:03:54,384 --> 00:03:57,012
I thought I'd write
to Sesame Street.
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,189
Because they were nice
when I was a little kid.
00:04:00,423 --> 00:04:02,084
No one ever wrote back.
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:05,125
A lot of those muppets
don't have thumbs.
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:11,360
All I got was a lousy key chain, and
by that time, I was living in a box.
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:13,262
I didn't have keys!
00:04:14,437 --> 00:04:15,631
I'm sorry, Phoebe.
00:04:15,905 --> 00:04:19,204
I wanted to do a good deed,
like you did with the babies.
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:23,740
This isn't a good deed. You just
want to get on TV. This is selfish.
00:04:23,947 --> 00:04:27,940
What about you having
those babies for your brother?
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:29,743
That's selfish!
00:04:31,654 --> 00:04:33,451
What are you talking about?
00:04:33,656 --> 00:04:36,887
It was a nice thing,
but it made you feel good, right?
00:04:37,126 --> 00:04:38,320
Yeah, so?
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:41,223
It made you feel good
so that makes it selfish.
00:04:41,464 --> 00:04:44,900
Look, there's no
unselfish good deeds. Sorry.
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:48,832
Yes, there are totally
good deeds that are selfless!
00:04:49,072 --> 00:04:50,903
May I ask for one example?
00:04:51,107 --> 00:04:53,974
Yeah, it's
You know, there's
00:04:54,177 --> 00:04:55,940
No, you may not!
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,807
Because all people are selfish.
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,983
Are you calling me selfish?
00:05:02,251 --> 00:05:04,583
Are you calling you people?
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:11,859
Sorry to burst that bubble, Phoebe,
but selfless good deeds don't exist.
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:14,125
You know the deal
on Santa Claus?
00:05:15,031 --> 00:05:20,162
I'll find a selfless good deed.
I'm going to beat you, you evil genius!
00:05:26,876 --> 00:05:29,106
Oh, my God! It's Emily!
00:05:29,345 --> 00:05:31,336
It's Emily, everyone!
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:38,514
I'm only ringing to say
stop harassing my relatives. Goodbye.
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:42,555
You can hang up, but I'll keep calling
everyone in England...
00:05:42,825 --> 00:05:46,556
...if that's what it takes
to get you to talk to me.
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,458
Really? About what?
00:05:48,664 --> 00:05:51,531
Look, you're my wife.
We're married.
00:05:51,734 --> 00:05:53,292
You know, I love you.
00:05:53,503 --> 00:05:55,630
I really miss you.
00:05:57,306 --> 00:05:58,671
I miss you too.
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:01,036
At least, I think I do.
00:06:01,577 --> 00:06:03,374
She's talking.
00:06:08,684 --> 00:06:11,551
When you said "the deal with Santa,"
you meant...?
00:06:11,754 --> 00:06:13,244
That he doesn't exist.
00:06:13,489 --> 00:06:14,717
Right.
00:06:19,595 --> 00:06:22,996
Chandler, have you heard
about Monica's secret boyfriend?
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,000
Yeah, she might have mentioned him.
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:32,102
So, Mon, when are we going
to meet this new, secret waiter man?
00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:35,508
I don't think he's
up to meeting everyone yet.
00:06:35,745 --> 00:06:38,213
Yeah, I don't think he's up to it.
00:06:38,714 --> 00:06:42,673
I want to meet this guy
who's the best sex she ever had.
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,182
Really?
00:06:47,223 --> 00:06:49,589
That's what you heard?
You said that?
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:51,253
I might have.
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,929
Why is that funny?
00:06:56,866 --> 00:06:59,198
Because I'm very happy for him.
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:02,067
And you!
You lucky dog!
00:07:06,442 --> 00:07:08,876
She's willing to work
on the relationship.
00:07:09,312 --> 00:07:10,301
That's great!
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,569
In London.
00:07:12,281 --> 00:07:14,647
She wants me to move to London.
00:07:14,884 --> 00:07:15,908
But you live here.
00:07:19,322 --> 00:07:20,584
You know that.
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,593
-What will you do?
-I don't know.
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,355
-I mean, I can't leave Ben.
-You can just video-conference with him.
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:32,731
I'm not ready to have a child.
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,795
I bet if I talked to Carol and Susan...
00:07:37,106 --> 00:07:40,872
...I could convince them
to move to London with Ben.
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,874
I'm sure your ex-wife
would be more than happy to move...
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,878
...so you can patch things up
with your new wife.
00:07:49,252 --> 00:07:50,947
It could happen.
00:07:53,422 --> 00:07:57,859
Ross, we are not moving to London.
We already have lives here.
00:07:58,027 --> 00:08:01,258
But it'd be great.
They have great theater...
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,126
...great accents.
00:08:05,334 --> 00:08:07,029
Tea.
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,904
They have a queen.
00:08:11,107 --> 00:08:13,302
-So?
-She's a woman.
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,078
-Daddy!
-Hey!
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:22,684
Guess what? We're moving to London!
00:08:23,653 --> 00:08:26,349
-Who's going to London?
-Nobody's going to London.
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,217
Welcome to London, governor.
00:08:29,825 --> 00:08:33,420
Right, right. It'll be great
because we'll have Big Ben and little Ben...
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,791
...in the same city.
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,531
Go pack!
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:41,696
See? See, he wants to go.
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:45,466
Yeah, we leave all our big decisions
to the 3-year-old.
00:08:46,342 --> 00:08:49,573
Come on, come on.
It'll be just like Three's Company...
00:08:49,745 --> 00:08:52,839
...only there's a kid and my wife...
00:08:53,015 --> 00:08:56,143
...and you're the gay ones.
00:09:01,224 --> 00:09:03,624
How you doing? Welcome.
Good to see you.
00:09:05,061 --> 00:09:06,460
This'll be your phone.
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:11,761
That's great.
00:09:12,034 --> 00:09:14,935
But I'm not really
expecting a lot of calls.
00:09:15,605 --> 00:09:17,630
No, you answer it
and take pledges.
00:09:18,207 --> 00:09:19,265
But I'm the host.
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:23,034
Gary Collins is the host.
You'll be answering the phone.
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,439
You don't seem to understand.
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray.
00:09:28,784 --> 00:09:31,150
Well, here's your phone, doctor.
00:09:33,956 --> 00:09:36,789
I can't believe I can't find
a selfless good deed.
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:39,391
You know that old guy
that lives next to me?
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:42,962
I snuck over there and raked up
the leaves on his front stoop.
00:09:43,232 --> 00:09:47,259
But he caught me, and he
force-fed me cider and cookies.
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:52,436
Then I felt wonderful.
That old jackass!
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:56,611
Maybe Joey's right.
Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:00,304
I will find a selfless good deed.
I gave birth to three children...
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:04,314
...and I won't let them be raised
in a world where Joey's right!
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,514
Can I ask you a cooking question?
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:11,659
If you're cooking on the stove...
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:15,795
...that means your new boyfriend
is better in bed than Richard?
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,298
Is he?
00:10:23,272 --> 00:10:27,504
I think I'll respect the privacy
of my new, secret boyfriend.
00:10:27,843 --> 00:10:29,105
Why?
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:32,878
If this guy was me...
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:37,381
...and it's me who'd learned that it was
me who was the best you'd ever had...
00:10:37,653 --> 00:10:38,950
...I'd be like this:
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,220
All right, Emily.
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,361
As much as I love you...
00:10:52,635 --> 00:10:55,968
...I'm sorry, I can't
move to London without Ben.
00:10:56,539 --> 00:10:59,030
I understand that would be difficult.
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:03,007
Would you consider moving here?
You were moving here anyway.
00:11:03,212 --> 00:11:05,146
Why can't you just do that?
00:11:05,715 --> 00:11:07,649
I don't know. It's just
00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:14,722
But I know that even though I've been
a complete idiot up till now...
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,685
...you have to come here.
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:20,026
You have to, so we can
work this out together.
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,325
All right.
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,059
Did you just say "all right"?
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,827
I did.
Now I'm the idiot.
00:11:28,037 --> 00:11:30,164
Emily, that is so great!
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:31,533
It'll be great!
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:35,700
We're going to be
like two idiots in love!
00:11:39,415 --> 00:11:42,282
There's one thing that
really scares me still.
00:11:42,551 --> 00:11:44,849
-Yes, tell me.
-You must understand...
00:11:45,087 --> 00:11:47,954
...how humiliating it was
for me at the altar...
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,351
...in front of my family and friends.
00:11:50,693 --> 00:11:53,526
I know. I am so sorry.
00:11:53,729 --> 00:11:57,563
And then, after deciding
to forgive you...
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,133
...seeing you at the airport,
catching our plane with her.
00:12:01,737 --> 00:12:04,262
Again, very sorry.
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:09,143
I mean, I can't be
in the same room as her.
00:12:09,412 --> 00:12:12,973
It drives me mad thinking of you
being in the same room as her.
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:17,441
Emily, there is nothing
between Rachel and me.
00:12:19,255 --> 00:12:20,950
I love you.
00:12:22,391 --> 00:12:23,824
All right.
00:12:24,393 --> 00:12:27,988
I'll come to New York,
and we'll try to make this work.
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,589
That's so great!
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:33,428
As long as you
don't see Rachel anymore.
00:12:41,243 --> 00:12:44,576
I asked Emily
if she would come to New York.
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,405
And she said yes.
00:12:46,782 --> 00:12:47,771
Great!
00:12:50,152 --> 00:12:53,315
Only if I promise
never to see Rachel again.
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:54,989
What? You can't
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,249
What did you say?
00:12:56,492 --> 00:13:01,020
I'd think about it. How am I
supposed to make this decision?
00:13:03,098 --> 00:13:05,328
I'm actually asking you!
00:13:07,002 --> 00:13:10,096
Rachel is one of your best friends.
00:13:12,007 --> 00:13:13,668
But Emily's his wife!
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,138
That's true!
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:20,148
You can't just cut Rachel
out of your life!
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,179
That's true!
00:13:23,686 --> 00:13:25,984
Thanks for the help.
Problem solved!
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,195
When will you be on TV?
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:39,968
There was kind of a mix-up
in my agent's office...
00:13:40,202 --> 00:13:42,636
...but I'm still on TV,
and that's good exposure.
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,138
You're not on TV.
00:13:49,044 --> 00:13:50,671
How about now?
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,739
There he is!
00:13:54,984 --> 00:13:56,815
Hello, New York!
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:02,155
Maybe just put the whole duck in there.
Who cares?
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:03,882
Now I got the legs.
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,697
How many times have I told you
to never watch the cooking channel?
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:18,406
I need that broiling pan
that Joey borrowed.
00:14:18,741 --> 00:14:20,231
That was yours?
00:14:20,576 --> 00:14:24,512
We used it when the duck
was throwing up caterpillars.
00:14:25,414 --> 00:14:28,110
Williams-Sonoma,
fall catalog, page 27.
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,908
Expect it in 4 to 6 weeks.
00:14:33,255 --> 00:14:36,224
Joey's at the telethon
for the rest of the day.
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,358
We have the place to ourselves.
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:40,028
Yeah, so?
00:14:40,229 --> 00:14:44,962
Maybe you'd want to book some time
with "the best you've ever had."
00:14:46,368 --> 00:14:48,233
You know what, champ?
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,732
I think I'll pass.
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:51,028
Why?
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,288
What's your point?
00:15:09,058 --> 00:15:11,686
With all the stupid gloating,
would you want to sleep with you?
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,261
Well, I think I'd be a little out of my league,
but I'd give it a shot.
00:15:19,702 --> 00:15:21,294
PBS Telethon.
00:15:22,738 --> 00:15:27,072
I just wanted to let you know
that I found a selfless good deed.
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:30,142
I went down to the park
and I let a bee sting me.
00:15:31,246 --> 00:15:33,441
What good is that going to do?
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:37,278
It helps the bee look tough
in front of his bee friends.
00:15:37,987 --> 00:15:40,717
The bee is happy,
and I am definitely not.
00:15:41,056 --> 00:15:44,617
You know, the bee probably
died after he stung you.
00:15:49,632 --> 00:15:50,826
Damn it!
00:15:52,901 --> 00:15:55,096
Back on in 30 seconds, people!
00:16:02,311 --> 00:16:05,246
Excuse me,
would you mind switching with me?
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:07,506
No way.
I'm in the shot, man.
00:16:08,484 --> 00:16:11,476
-You've been here all day!
-I'm taking pledges.
00:16:11,787 --> 00:16:14,187
And we're on three, two...
00:16:15,024 --> 00:16:16,992
Welcome back to our fall telethon.
00:16:17,192 --> 00:16:20,025
If you've been enjoying
Cirque du Soleil...
00:16:20,262 --> 00:16:24,198
...and you'd like to see more,
it's very simple.
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:27,458
All you have to do
is call in a pledge...
00:16:27,703 --> 00:16:32,766
...and tell one of our volunteers
what type of programming you
00:16:36,111 --> 00:16:39,308
-Quick broiling pan question
-Yes, it really does cost that much.
00:16:39,481 --> 00:16:42,644
Maybe next time your duck can puke
in something from Pottery Barn.
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:50,091
That's it. I cannot make this decision.
It is too difficult.
00:16:50,392 --> 00:16:53,486
I leave it entirely
up to the gods of fate.
00:16:56,331 --> 00:16:57,662
A Magic 8 Ball?
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,595
You can't make this decision
with a toy!
00:17:00,803 --> 00:17:02,771
It's not a toy.
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:06,739
I don't know what else to do!
00:17:06,975 --> 00:17:11,241
I either keep my wife
and lose one of my best friends...
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,280
...or I get divorced
for the second time before I'm 30.
00:17:15,484 --> 00:17:18,851
If anyone else has
a better suggestion, let's hear it.
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,453
Because I got nothing!
Don't be shy.
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,954
Any suggestion will do.
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,023
Okay, then.
00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:35,827
Here we go.
00:17:37,206 --> 00:17:38,764
Magic 8 Ball...
00:17:39,007 --> 00:17:41,771
...should I never see Rachel again?
00:17:45,547 --> 00:17:46,673
"Ask Again Later."
00:17:49,051 --> 00:17:51,542
Later is not good enough!
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:58,815
"Ask Again Later."
00:17:59,061 --> 00:18:00,187
What the hell?
00:18:00,395 --> 00:18:02,727
This is broken! It is broken!
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:05,658
Let me see.
00:18:06,702 --> 00:18:09,193
Will Chandler have sex tonight?
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:11,232
"Don't Count On It."
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:17,802
Seems like it works to me.
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:21,249
Okay, one more time.
00:18:22,317 --> 00:18:25,411
Should I never see Rachel again?
00:18:27,589 --> 00:18:30,387
Magic 8 Ball! What did you ask?
00:18:34,263 --> 00:18:35,753
Does...
00:18:35,931 --> 00:18:40,300
...Rachel get to pick the movie
that we're all going to see tonight?
00:18:40,469 --> 00:18:42,630
Excellent. What's the answer?
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,938
Looks like Stella's gonna get
her groove back tonight!
00:18:51,013 --> 00:18:52,913
What? I heard it was good.
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,913
PBS Telethon.
00:18:58,086 --> 00:18:59,075
Hi, Joey.
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,377
Hey, Phoebe.
00:19:00,589 --> 00:19:02,079
I'd like
to make a pledge.
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,359
I would like to donate $200.
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,754
Two hundred dollars?
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,825
You sure?
After what Sesame Street did to you?
00:19:09,031 --> 00:19:11,499
I'm still mad at them,
but they bring happiness...
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:15,191
...to lots of kids
whose moms didn't kill themselves.
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:21,999
By supporting them, I'm doing a good
thing, but I'm not happy about it.
00:19:22,277 --> 00:19:24,802
So there!
A selfless good deed.
00:19:25,013 --> 00:19:27,675
You don't feel good
about donating the money?
00:19:27,883 --> 00:19:31,375
No, it sucks!
I was saving up to buy a hamster.
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,681
A hamster?
Those things are, like, $10.
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,120
Not the one I had my eye on.
00:19:37,693 --> 00:19:41,629
It looks like we have surpassed
last year's pledge total.
00:19:41,897 --> 00:19:42,886
Thank you!
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:48,702
And the pledge that did it
was taken by one of our volunteers.
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:54,102
Oh, boy! And may I say,
one of our sharpest dressed volunteers.
00:19:54,977 --> 00:19:57,104
Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!
00:19:57,312 --> 00:19:58,404
Oh, look!
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,241
Joey's on TV!
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,711
Isn't that great?
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:05,546
My pledge got Joey on TV!
That makes me feel so
00:20:05,754 --> 00:20:06,982
Oh, no!
00:20:14,263 --> 00:20:15,252
Look...
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:19,730
...I got carried away before,
but there's something you got to know.
00:20:19,935 --> 00:20:24,429
If I'm the best, it's only
because you made me the best.
00:20:26,441 --> 00:20:27,908
Keep talking.
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,638
I was nothing before you.
00:20:30,913 --> 00:20:33,108
Call the other girls and ask.
00:20:34,016 --> 00:20:36,007
Which wouldn't take long.
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:40,318
But when I'm with you,
and we're together...
00:20:40,589 --> 00:20:43,183
...oh, my God!
00:20:48,297 --> 00:20:51,027
-Really?
-Oh, my God!
00:20:54,269 --> 00:20:58,171
I understand if you never
want to sleep with me again.
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,203
But that would be wrong.
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,935
We're too good.
00:21:03,312 --> 00:21:05,780
We owe it to sex!
00:21:08,116 --> 00:21:09,140
If we owe it!
00:21:12,788 --> 00:21:13,982
Oh, my!
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,019
When will Joey be home?
00:21:17,392 --> 00:21:20,020
I was kind of hoping
we could do this without him.
00:21:21,997 --> 00:21:24,795
No, no, no!
Leave the gloves on.
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,967
I cleaned the bathroom.
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,397
Why don't we lose the gloves.
00:21:33,075 --> 00:21:36,067
All right.
Let's show them how it's done.
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,171
-You know that wasn't part of it?
-I know.
00:21:56,531 --> 00:21:58,897
You ready?
We're going to be late.
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:02,068
-For what?
-For Stella, remember?
00:22:02,337 --> 00:22:05,067
She's getting her groove back
in 20 minutes.
00:22:06,608 --> 00:22:09,202
I totally forgot about that.
00:22:10,112 --> 00:22:13,673
Can I take a rain check?
I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,545
Sure, I guess.
00:22:16,952 --> 00:22:19,443
I hear you don't have to
go to London.
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:26,523
It's not that easy. There's still
a lot of relationship stuff.
00:22:27,062 --> 00:22:28,086
Like what?
00:22:28,363 --> 00:22:29,887
Just stuff.
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:33,864
You know, kind of what Emily wants.
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:36,594
Talk to me.
Maybe I can help.
00:22:39,374 --> 00:22:40,932
You can't help.
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:46,479
I have to do this
without your help.
00:22:49,384 --> 00:22:53,650
I know you can do that too.
I'm just saying if you need to talk...
00:22:57,659 --> 00:22:58,921
Thanks.
00:23:03,432 --> 00:23:06,230
Whatever it is that Emily wants...
00:23:06,435 --> 00:23:08,403
...just give it to her.
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:11,071
The bottom line is that you love her.
00:23:11,273 --> 00:23:13,434
Fix whatever she wants fixed.
00:23:14,109 --> 00:23:15,508
Just do it.
00:23:17,345 --> 00:23:21,475
You're going to have to try.
You'll hate yourself if you don't.
00:23:25,187 --> 00:23:26,620
Come on, answer it!
00:23:30,525 --> 00:23:32,015
Hi, sweetie.
00:23:32,861 --> 00:23:33,850
Good.
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:40,165
Yes, I've been thinking...
00:23:40,435 --> 00:23:44,371
...about that thing
you wanted me to do.
00:23:45,874 --> 00:23:46,932
I can do it.
00:23:49,444 --> 00:23:51,844
Will you come to New York?
00:24:33,688 --> 00:24:35,679
-Never done that before.
-Nope.
